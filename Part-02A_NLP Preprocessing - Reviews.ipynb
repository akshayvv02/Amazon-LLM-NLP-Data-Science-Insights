    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing text data is a crucial step in any natural language processing (NLP) project, ensuring that the data is clean and ready for analysis. In this notebook, we focus on preparing Amazon reviews for the \"Miracle Noodle Zero Carb, Gluten Free Shirataki Pasta, Spinach Angel Hair\" product using SpaCy, a powerful NLP library. This preprocessing step involves several key tasks to clean and transform the text data into a usable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Inspect Data**:\n",
    "   - Efficiently load the raw review files and metadata for the selected product.\n",
    "   - Examine the structure and basic statistics of the dataset, identifying any missing values or duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clean the Text Data**:\n",
    "   - Combine the review text and summary into a single comprehensive text column.\n",
    "   - Remove unwanted elements such as HTML tags and URLs to ensure clean text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preprocess Text with SpaCy**:\n",
    "   - Create a custom SpaCy NLP pipeline to tokenize, remove stopwords, and lemmatize the text.\n",
    "   - Generate multiple versions of the processed text for different analytical purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save the Processed Data**:\n",
    "   - Save the cleaned and preprocessed reviews in a JSON file for use in subsequent analysis and modeling steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will have a well-preprocessed set of Amazon reviews, ready for detailed analysis to extract valuable insights into customer preferences and sentiments.\n"
