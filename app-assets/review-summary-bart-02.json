Shirataki noodles are an interesting substitute for regular pasta. They smell a bit funky when they come out of the package, but after boiling in water they get better. The texture of the noodles is rubber in texture and they don't absorb the cooking sauce. They taste okay, but with my homemade pasta sauce with ground turkey, it was delicious. I will make some \"Ketogenic\" stir fry chicken, Bok Choy & noodles (using a package of Miracle Noodles for dinner tonight, and I already have plans to make pho with these noodles.  They are fat-free and low in calories, so they are a good choice for people watching carbs.  I lost 20 lbs, but I have another 20 more to lose.   They taste like sewage, so I will go back to using spagetti squash and brown rice, but it's not a good idea to eat them all by themselves, as they are bad for you, because they are full of fat, so you have to use some kind of food afterwards to get rid of the bad stuff, as recommended by the health conscience person, as well as the food processor. They are good for the health conscious person, but not so good for those who don't want to eat meat, vegetables, or carbs, or have a lot of them, as a side dish, as I did. "}
