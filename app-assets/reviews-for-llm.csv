A3Y51NV9HU5T2,"Four Stars: Great pasta taste and feel, but the spell in the packaged is SKRONG!",4
A3D7EFSRC6Y9MP,"Okay but don't like texture: The texture just made it a little strange to eat. Otherwise the flavor is okay, very bland so add spices.",3
A4AM5KBP3I2R,Go for the green noodles: The herb flavor makes the odd texture of shirataki much more palatable.,5
A3GHK4IL78DB7Y,"Its an awesome substitute.: I didn't have a problem at all with a half filled bag or anything that other users said. I was concerned at first but I took a chance and there were no problems.
I find the best way to get rid of the initial smell is to boil it will a cube of bouillon. The texture is really good and I don't notice it at all. I could replace every noodle I ever eat with these and I wouldnt mind!",5
AH3B94LQOPPY6,Five Stars: They taste like whatever you cook them with. ,5
A2H67TFYT5QSIZ,"Love them!: Coming from an Italian girl who can't resist a pasta dish, these have been my savior for when I'm avoiding carbs but still want a tasty meal. Yes they smell a little funky when you first open the package but it goes away after rincing in water. I don't even miss regular pasta anymore, these are my go-to. Love them!!",5
A3HR3J6SE2H55Q,"tastes okay: The taste is just okay, but what do you really expect for zero calories?  I ate them for lunch most days while dieting, usually with a little fat free italian dressing (35 calories.)  And yeah, it wasn't a gourmet meal, but I lost 20 lbs, and didn't have to feel hungry.  I'm pretty sick of them now, but I do have another 20 or so to lose so I might go for it again.

The smell- it's really just the liquid it's packed in.  Rinse them for about 5 minutes and don't go out of your way to smell it.  It goes away so it's really not a big deal.",5
A2WW04WY38AJIE,"How do you rate noodles: I like the noodles.  How do you rate such a thing.  Invest a few dollars and try a package or 2.  I can't tell anyone else what they will like.  I know some people who consider them tasteless.  I think they are very good.  They are bland, like any noodle but they have a taste and are very versatile.  I think you can use them as a replacement in any noodle recipe.",4
ABXPARMCPVD2M,Five Stars: It's got a smell to it but once you rinse the rice it's good,5
A8T2QOLXSTRJ7,Not too bad.: Rinse them thoroughly before using band they're not bad. I like being able to not make zucchini spirals and just have lazier pasta without the guilt. My kids wouldn't touch them with a 10ft pole.,3
A1GXGHMSY5OP2O,NOT A GOOD TASTE: Taste so bad.,2
ADT1AJREFFG0X,"Great pasta alternative: Great low calorie, healthy pasta alternative for anyone watching carbs.",5
A6NOJK8L50EAA,the noodles and rice fill like rubber in texture and don't absorb the cooking sauce: the noodles and rice fill like rubber in texture and don't absorb the cooking sauce. I will go back to using spagetti squash and brown rice.,2
A26RU99Z7SCFP3,Two Stars: Not good lol. Like not god at all.,2
A3SN6DR8NWPKH,"Hooked on the spaghetti.: Loved the thin noodles but was not a fan of the fettuccine- they were just too thick. I will definitely be ordering more of the spaghetti though. Once you find the best balance of how long to boil them and then dry them, they actually taste better than regular noodles.",4
A3PZTCK56OXCJU,One Star: Taste like sewage,1
A1BJHJHVIRW1HD,"Perfect for the health nut! LOVE!: These things are great! My family likes just plain white pasta but as a health conscience person, I ordered these for myself. Yes, I was skeptical and they do have a different texture than your standard pasta, but with my homemade pasta sauce with ground turkey, it was delicious. If you don't mind a little crunch to your pasta, like japanese noodles you get in a sushi restaurant, you'll like these, just rinse them off and put them in boiling water for one minute and that's it! I think they are fabulous and so healthy! NO CARBS! yay! Also fat free and low or no calories. You don't have to feel guilty for having that piece of garlic bread with your pasta anymore! Try them! Once you get past the texture, you'll love them!",5
AOSNKC5DFGGK0,Four Stars: Easy and good =),4
A2EUE2IGIGCGWF,"These noodles are just what I was hoping for...I love them!: So I decided to make some ""Ketogenic"" stir fry chicken, Bok Choy & noodles (using a package of Miracle Noodle Fettuccini) for dinner tonight. I've read reviews about how their noodles came out gummy or tasteless but to me these taste just like rice vermicelli noodles which I love! If someone were to have made my dinner and served it to me I woul have never guessed that it was no carb noodles! I already have plans to make pho with these! Great job on these noodles Miracle Noodle!",5
A1K12Z9DMNSLCS,"Edible 'rubber'?: This Shirataki pasta was really weird to chew - it kept squishing in between my teeth, but would returned to it's original shape. Sort of like gummy bears, but much harder to break down. This was nothing close to a pasta ""feel"".  After the first bite (tried the noodles for some low-carb marinara sauce I had made), I threw the rest in the trash.",1
A33C8094UUIHHN,"THE Perfect Noodle!!: I can't believe how amazing these noodles are! Just grateful that I found them Full of protein and no  discernible calories, they take on the flavor of whatever I am creating. Savory dish after savory dish these needles accommodate to every  delectable  culinary creation!",5
A12XSK18XHGDFK,Horrible!: They taste like rubber. Non eatable!,1
ATIRJJIHJCDC6,"Interesting texture: Followed the directions, it came out well. Interesting texture. Glad I mixed it with a recipe instead of eating it plain.",4
A2QAKQCRCAPEHM,One Star: Tastes like rubber,1
A3D1S2RZ9F1HF7,"Disgusting: This is gross. You like noodles and rice because of their dry, binding texture and this is nothing like it. The noodles are crunchy in a cucumber wet like way, don't absorb flavor at all and nothing sticks to them. I am a big fan of healthy, guilt-free products but this product's lack of calories comes at the price.",1
A1SP6NKC0Y4JWS,great tasting noodles and easy to use: awesome noodles! they take flavor great and they taste better then ramen noodles! they are great in the chicken teriyaki I made the other night! it was to die for!,5
A19UPE6MBSWXL5,"tasted like rubberbands.: Nope never again, the smell enough was a turnoff, even after rinsing multiple times, drying as instructed then cooking...tasted like rubberbands....",1
A1HQVPRWORA87L,Five Stars: Great stuff to use when you don't want to use pasta to lose weight,5
A3SYBQ9H0IIC8X,"Good enough to experiment with: Having tried the very curly  Better Than Noodles brand and liking it, I wanted to try something more like fettuccine or linguine. So the Miracle Noodle Zero Carb looked more like it . It is quite different though. The noodles look like translucent rubberbandlike ribbons. Very long, some seem to be 18 inches long. I had to snip them into shorter lengths. As these noodles don't really have any taste by themselves they depend on what you mix them with. What you have to adjust to is the ""mouthfeel"", which is sort of a rubbery al dente and slippery.  Sauces also don't seem to adhere to them as they do to ""normal"" noodles, and they are tricky to catch with your fork. You can certainly get used to them, but there is no ""love affair"" between your tongue and your food as there is with regular pasta. But, they also don't have the carbs and calories that ""normal"" noodles have. I will finish this batch, but won't order any more.",3
A1HPVBD81O47O4,One Star: not eatable,1
A20ISOBZM6FVZU,Five Stars: as expected,5
AWUOWS53AQ3IY,"Great noodles, easy to make, love having low carb noodles to turn to!: Between kelp noodles, homemade spiral-cut zucchini noodles and these Miracle noodles, I am just thrilled to have three low carb noodle options. I've been trying to eat paleo and low carb for a couple years now, and I've been missing noodles in my diet. I had been gluten free for a few years before going paleo, and had gotten used to a variety of gluten free noodles. But I had to give those up to go paleo and low carb. Now I have these three noodle alternatives I can turn to at a moment's notice to make a ""pasta"" dish of any kind.

The Miracle noodles smell strange when you open the bag, but that smell does not transfer to the finished noodles. I have tried the noodles with tomato sauce and vodka sauce.",5
A19XTSXF8DMPV0,They do what they say.: They are a decent filler if you cook them properly.  Not much taste but they are a good diet food. They don't smell the greatest raw but once cooked they are pretty good!,4
AN6W32B2IDZAM,Four Stars: Tastes just as advertised. Was expecting more noodles though.,4
A3CQ4YC5GV99DW,Five Stars: Great for people who need to avoid carbs.,5
A17LK2WW6EKUMG,"Delicious: I love these, Im still going to buy them, but two of the packs i received weren't angel hair. They were more like angel pubic hair. Idk what happened but they weren't normal.

Still, these are so delicious and taste like normal noodles. Im super picky too!",4
AW8WGWRGR3LOT,Couldn't get over the smell...: I never got around to eating the noodles.  I just couldn't get past the smell.  Rinsing just didn't cut it.  Had to practically fumigate my kitchen.,1
A5BEPWYZEDB6T,"This product had the expected bad smell when first opened: I have tried other products such as No Oodle and those were at least palatable after careful rinsing.  This product had the expected bad smell when first opened, but rinsing produced a slimy mess that actually began oozing out of the strainer I used to rinse them.  I cannot comment on taste as they were just too disgusting of a mess to even try them.  Don't waste your money.",1
AMJG7TPV1R2T8,"Preach. Miracle Noodle: These noodles are AWESOME! I read about them online and was skeptical. I actually really like them. I have only used them as udon noodles but they were so good. They are kind of small, like I can easily eat a whole bag. I pictured them being equal to a pound of pasta, which is not the case. I can also eat a lot, but still, just a heads up.",5
A1181E0KN1OTWU,"I love these noodles: I love these noodles. They're a real life savor for those of us who can't have carbs. They may smell ""fishy"" when you first open the package, but rinse them for a couple minutes in cold water and you're good to go! They absorb the flavor of whatever you cook them with (be sure to have at least a tablespoon of ""sause"" for them to suck up).",5
A1QB9C1XJ46RJF,Three Stars: not good tasting,3
A87T1J58RN6QJ,Obviously they don't taste like real noodles but they do the trick: Obviously they don't taste like real noodles but they do the trick. They stay consistently solid when cooked. You can definitely flavor them up a bit,4
A1HNSQ9M5BUA1Z,"Think twice - a lot of Prep Work: Oh, my goodness.  I want to return them - the smell was scarey.  I let them rinse under cold water about 3-4 times.  Strained them 3 times - they are a lot of work to get rid of the smell.  Finally, smell
free.  I was so tired from the prep work I didn't want to eat them.  I made taquitos in my toaster oven.  Then dinner time came - I poured tomatoes & basil sauce in the slimmy noodles.  I took one small bite - I will try again later.  Please can I get my money back and return these to you?
Nothing like I thought the would be.",1
A3OGOWRGAN9AR9,"Meh okay to try but not a regular order item: Will not be buying again only becuase of fishy smell, odd squishy texture and not very filling for cost. Something different to try in you are going low-carb, but not something we will be adding to our weekly menus. Plain old spaghetti squash just tastes, looks, and smells better and is far less costly per serving. Seems overly processed too.",3
A2YS0F8KKFMXAK,"yeah!!!: this is a great substitute when you are on a diet and craving pasta!! I was able to make an Chinese style stir fry with this,",5
A30MG34IGRR420,GAG ME!!!: I couldn't even cook them. Worst smell ever. Like bad fish!!!,1
A1THB3MGSE99SX,"These noodles work great in stir fries and chicken soup: I have been eating Shirataki noodles for over a year as as I'm on a low carb, diabetic friendly diet.  These noodles work great in stir fries.  I also use them in easy cassaroles (combine chicken, veggies, a can of soup, the noodles; top it with a little cheese, and then bake).  No, you would never mistake these noodles for pasta but they are enjoyable in their own right, and super filling.  I love Fettuccini shaped the best, and these garlic ones fit into my recipes, going really well with chicken.  The angel hair works perfectly in chicken soup!",5
ANR1PYQKPY4IY,Five Stars: They taste fine. Just be sure to rinse them thoroughly as the directions say.  I bought more.,5
A18T7WH40OXZLB,"Great Product: I love these  miracle noodles. They taste great when you mix in your favorite meat, vegatables etc.  They are light and satisfying, i don't buy ranzoni pastan any longer :)",5
A1925T5KQ0WMPO,"Not great but fill the need.: The smell is overwhelming, but after all its like over cooked pasta. Squishy but sauce over it helps. So fits the need and yurn for pasta.",4
A3IQE8H7U4VSKX,Love them!: Yummmm!  Love them!,5
A1M84J5NIOC65G,Konjac noodles: This is an awesome product. Make sure you are prepared to rinse well the noodles and package. packaging loquid has a fishy smell that is quickly and easily washes way. Product is easy to prepare and performs as expected.,5
A2UNKKZDP6EBIL,"It was wonderful : Yes it was my carb fix with no carbs. I mixed it with spices, fresh lemon and peeled shrimp!!! It was wonderful ",5
AVY8CRO70DIRW,Five Stars: Very good replacement for pasta.,5
A1RLVQMIGJRBNS,Not for me!: I really wanted to like these but these made me nausea :(,2
A1PBGBXE99Z0KW,Five Stars: It was excellent! I highly recommend it to anyone. Just be sure to follow the instructions as listed.,5
AGY8BJEU4N1Y7,No need to limit your pasta desire.: Perfect item for my spouse who is doing low carb meals only.  They are so easy to prepare.  The smell is very strong shrimp but when rinsed well and prepared according to directions that is eliminated.  If used regularly it serves a worthwhile purpose.  Definitely recommend for anyone who is wanting another pasta substitute.  Package arrived in perfect condition and on time.  Price was very good.,5
A3J0WFZ5GWZ33I,"It promises it contains ""nothing"" and it delivers: No taste, texture is bad, impossible to cook.  It saves calories and delivers no carbs - because you'll never eat it.",1
A3GC143OUB4Q4D,The angel hair and rice is really good. The fettuccini because it was thicker seemed chewy: The angel hair and rice is really good. The fettuccini because it was thicker seemed chewy. I would get the other two again.,4
A343UIF27ZMD2K,"The product is great on my keto diet so I will keep it: I ordered a six-pack of ziti noodles but, instead recieved a six pack of rice. The product is great on my keto diet so I will keep it, but it just isn't what I ordered.",3
A167I9QSWFTO75,Works for me: I have ordered these 3 times because I keep sharing them with people. They are Not your traditional noodle but what do you expect for 0 carbs 0 fat etc. My husband can make a shoe taste good so if you can make a good sauce this works great if you are on a low carb diet. We cook it way longer than the directions and add oil while boiling. I gave it 5 stars because it delivers what it promises.,5
AW27HHPMUDLV8,Three Stars: Very expensive. I found some others at www.skinnynoodles.com. Very affordable.,3
A1N3ERI3GL343H,"I've loved these for years!: It's true that these do have a strange smell when you first open and it's best to rinse them really thoroughly, but I've really come to love them!  My favorite thing to do is to use them in a pad thai - the texture really serves the dish well and it cuts out SO many calories!",5
AIVYP7GJPMP12,Rubbery and no flavor: We bought these noodles when we decided to start a low carb lifestyle.  I expected to be able to use them as filler when a recipe called for pasta.  I would rather eat the dish without.  They are rubbery and if you don't rinse them THOROUGHLY they will have a VERY weird taste.  I do not recommend these noodles.,2
A3S0VRFAGZ3OZJ,"Tasty stuff!: These taste great when prepared per instructions. I love how quick they are to make, and they go with anything. Great find, although a bit expensive. Would prefer to buy them locally, too.",5
A3HRWZW3ZK6W49,"Good Noodle Alternative: I have become a pretty big fan on Shirataki noodles.  I like this variety pack as it gives you a little variation in the noodles.  They all smell a little like seaweed when you first open them, but once you wash them off & boil them, I don't smell it or taste it.  It's a great way to kind of fool yourself into thinking you are getting carbs.  I like to put a little herb & garlic spaghetti sauce on the spaghetti noodles, a little low-fat alfredo sauce on the fettuccini noodles & I just add a little Mrs. Dash to the rice (& eat it with fish).  So, you are getting minimal calories & a nice variety to your meals.  I think the price is a little high, but I do enjoy them.",4
A2LY9VOGMFW0HO,"quick - tasty - filling: It has everything that I need for a quick tasty accompaniment for a low calorie meal...dump it into a colander, run very hot water over it, add ""stuff"" of your choice and enjoy your filling meal.",5
A2EZ7TG5TXEEZX,"Different...still testing: These have a very different texture than noodles but, hey what did I expect.  They are extremely filling and I am still experimenting with how to use them.  Good and satisfying for keeping your tummy full while dieting.",3
A2KALERAOHKAGP,They are terrific deformed watching calories but you will need to figure ...: This will take some getting used to. They are terrific for watching calories but you will need to figure out ways to cook them so they will taste better!,2
A3NXRVLDSG03Y4,"Good sub: My husband has to watch his carbs, but he loves pasta. With these noodles he can still have the large serving he is used to. He adds lots of meat and veggies for a healthy meal.",5
A2QQ1IXHWZUI42,"Great low carb replacement.: My husband stumble upon this while trying to find a pasta replacement for his low carb diet. Let me tell you, as an Italian, I was very skeptical but these are great! They taste good, don't take long to cook, and are good for you. We've got my husbands extended family hooked on these as well.",5
A3UIR0H95C61RA,"Yum!: Please be sure to follow the instructions on how to prepare this before bailing on this product. If done right, it retains shape, does not have any weird tastes and can absorb flavors as subtle as butter only!",5
A3HJ695IDIW3C8,don't ever eat noodles again: these noodles are amazing. they basically taste like nothing (similar to regular pasta) and u can add amazing sauces and not feel guilty about the carbs.,5
AF0P43HUK76AZ,"One Star: This stuff is awful, I can't stand the texture.",1
A11GZVI4IPZPL1,Love these low-carb low-calorie noodles: Love these low-carb low-calorie noodles. Sticking to a low-carb diet is really hard and these noodles make it possible for me,5
A1TGG773VOJE11,Guiltless Goodness!: Absolutely love these noodles! I use them in ramen recipes. All the slurping. None of guilt. The longer it sits in any kind of broth or sauce. The more flavor they pick up.,5
AH7BLIW376BQU,Four Stars: Filling pasta replacement,4
A1YW4T4HX8I0CW,"Rubber Rice: I trusted the reviews. Terrible. Tried the tic and I don't want to try the rest. More like rubber rice.

Id love if I could return the remaining packages for a refund.",1
A1O8Z2UK01LF6E,One Star: Terrible taste. Terrible smell.  Terrible texture.,1
A32BF0M7JPDY5Z,Two Stars: Smell fishy and are slimy.,2
A2Y9K2E4IT0N5N,"I got bloated - Not for everyone: The taste is good, no smell after preparation and it fills you up. However, the fiber made me super bloated - My stomach turned hard and swollen.  I tried it two times to make sure it wasn't a fluke, and sure enough I got the same problem the second time around. Sorry, but no ""miracle"" here.",2
A1J5MXYK4S4AL9,"I'm pretty sure I have a new favorite food: I'm not gonna lie. I was scared of these. BUT my lack of carbs and needing to find a pasta substitute caused me to be brave.

I'm pretty sure I have a new favorite food! Angel Hair is by far the best- least squishy texture after cooking. Tried the fettuccine as well, wasn't AS good. Have yet to try the ""rice"".

Don't sniff the bag or contents straight out of bag. Other than that the smell is pretty much unnoticeable.

I took the pasta out of the bag and drained. Rinsed, rinsed and rinsed some more. Then boiled the pasta for 3 minutes. Drained again. Tossed in a dry frying pan. I cooked a bit longer than most I think, made sure to get all the liquid out. Tossed with tongs pretty much the whole time, separating it. I can tell they're about done when they make a good ""squeaking"" noise when separating them in the pan.

Added some veggies and peanut sauce.

Probably the best Keto meal I've had in months! Added a little siracha sauce for some kick!

Didn't turn out super pretty- but was seriously delicious!",5
A3RIFBNJ6KP3L3,"Low-Carb Lifesaver! Just take the time to prepare them properly!: You must cook them properly! Drain and rinse thoroughly under cold water, put in already boiling water for 3-4 minutes, drain, place in already med-high heat skillet with no oil and stir around for 5-10 mins until as much water as possible burns off. If you spend a few extra minutes to do this (easy while you're preparing the rest of your meal) they turn out great. They have a very pasta-like texture and take on the flavor of whatever sauce you cook them in. The (to me) slightly briny smell and gummy texture completely disappears with this method of cooking. A life saver in a low carb diet when you're craving noodles!",5
A9IEYMM0KP8YE,Five Stars: love them!!!,5
A27RUAGFARI2F7,"which is fine. There was also no smell once rinsed: This was a NO GO for this low carb family. The TEXTURE is what makes these noodles intolerable. There is literally no taste whatsoever, which is fine. There was also no smell once rinsed, thank goodness. The texture had an intolerable ""crunch"". Sorry, but nope!",1
A337BJJQYPO5X9,Tasteless with nasty texture.: These were tasteless with a truly horrid texture.  Try an individual bag if you must try. I ended up throwing the entire box away.,1
AQFF452SVDF48,"Not for me: I followed tips I found on Amazon to try to make this product better.  I rinsed it in a colander to try to get rid of the odd 'fishy' smell.  I tried cooking it several ways following directions I found from people who liked it.  I could not get past the texture of it.  However, I must say that I had some kids here who loved it in a cheese sauce.  I sent it home with their mother and although she wouldn't eat it, she fixed it for the kids and they gobbled it up.  For me, I'll just stick with spiralizing my veggies.",2
AVUJ2UJHZT11M,Two Stars: Very bland.,2
A28TJUQYYJO7DC,Five Stars: Excellent !,5
A3B4YNM2VCQ42U,One Star: This product tasted fishy and the texture was slimy,1
A8DDM5DL3RK0F,Busted Bags leaking everywhere: Every single bag was busted and leaking. I could smell it even as the delivery guy handed me the box. Should have just gone to the store.,1
A3HYXJ0NCT7RKE,Five Stars: Just as described,5
A3SEH86WO5SMVO,"Great pasta alternative: When I first tried this style pasta, I was hearing bad things about the smell, the taste and the more time consuming prep time. I was told I would need to soak them in water for 15 - 20 minutes, boil them, then add them to the dish.

The first time I used them I opened the package and nothing, no smell. It wasn't until I got extremely close that I could smell anything at all, and even then it wasn't bad. All I do now is quickly rinse off the pasta and boil 2-3 minutes if needed. Normally I just throw it directly in the pan to absorb some of the sauce goodness.

This pasta is excellent. I would highly recommend this as an alternative to the standard pasta. I've cut all carbs down to 20 or a less a day, and this helps with any craving of standard pasta.",5
A11DKZ6J7FQ92J,"Miracle Noodles: We absolutely love the miracle noodles (angel hair pasta and fettuccine). Tried to make fried rice with the miracle rice. It was ok but will not make it again. I used a package of angel hair pasta and miracle rice and made a big pot of chicken noddle and rice soup. This was delicious.  The miracle rice makes a good filler in soups. Highly recommended.  Follow the directions. Rinse, boil, put in dry skillet or pan and cook until they squeek. You will know when they are ready to use when you hear it. I did findfind a recipe for pizza crust. I printed it and will try soon.",5
A1VW2CWBKMHCQ5,"Worth a shot: Hubby and I have been Keto since Oct, sadly missing pasta some days. So even though people have said there is a string fishy odor I decided to give them a shot. I rinsed for about 2-3 minutes turning them with my hand every 30 seconds or so. First time we tried this with a creamy garlic sauce with chicken, it was ok. I had a very hard time eating them like noodles. Second time I made them I cut them so they were smaller pieces and used an Asian base of coconut aminos and sesame oil added cabbage, chicken and onion for a stir fry. We definitely like them better in our stir fry kinda like a ramen noodle. Ill be buying the rice and Alfredo noodles since I was pleasantly surprised with these!",4
ACSC1LGRRR8VW,"Fishy rice: Some things are too good to be true.  No carbs, no sugar, no calories BUT very fishy smell.  I thoroughly rinsed them in hot water and then cold water and just couldn't get over the fishy smell.  I attempted to eat them with stir fry in hopes the garlic and soy sauce could mask the smell.",1
A1B0SEWSF5A5TM,"Pleasantly Surprised!: I purchased these 3 months ago and procrastinated on trying them until last night.  Quite frankly.... I was SURE I would hate them and be disappointed!  I am trying to eat ""Grain Free"" and missing pasta terribly!  I was totally surprised and loved the stir fry chicken and vegetable dish I prepared last night.  I rinsed Angle Hair well in cold water, added to boiling water for 2 minutes and drained.  Tossed in hot fry pan until most of the water was gone and added to my stir fry pan to mix in and absorb those flavors and sauce.  I will be using these several times a week and trying other products made by this company!",5
AKRZSLATNVUH6,Good concept: Definitely an acquired taste.,1
A30KRD5W5FS21Q,Five Stars: will buy again,5
A2XUQMXYOQDWND,Good stuff.: I reorder this frequently.  I really like it.,5
A32YFPY1SXQSJ6,Five Stars: Bough for a friend. She loves it,5
A1N9MG3G1XJ911,"Bleh: These taste ok, but I seriously couldn't get over the smell. Once it was in my nose it was all I could think about. Now I have 3 bags of this stuff I won't eat :-/",3
A2L6CR7ZPP1C4V,Vermicelli is great substitute.: Smells awful. Rinse thoroughly!,3
AUMFSW1YZI5NZ,"Great Idea: I wanted to try these because I thought it would be too good to be true. Turns out I was wrong! They are great.
They don't have any flavor- you have to add all of that. The fishy smell is really not a big deal and goes away if you rinse them as it says to do on the package. The texture is NOT like regular pasta by any means.. the closest I can think of would be Asian udon noodles. They are a bit more rubbery than regular noodles but nothing that you wouldn't be able to get used to if you are trying to cut back on pasta. Will repurchase. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish the noodles were cut a bit shorter.",4
AZ57CJQDSJFXG,A true miracle.: The best thing to happen to a low or no carb diet. Perfect texture and taste.,5
A11ANU6GE9S1PS,"Rubbery but workable: These noodles are a little rubbery, but they take on the flavor of whatever you make, so not bad if you are avoiding carbs like the plague. Zero carbs!",5
A1841W8Z5FC5TN,"Great ""Non-Pasta"" Pasta Option!: Really like this product.  I have tried kelp noodles before and I like the shirataki noodles much better. They have a better texture and taste less fishy.  I do agree with another reviewer, it is imperative to rinse this product thoroughly. Texture is great, lighter than pasta but very enjoyable.  Will definitely purchase again!",5
A2QYHJFKT4EREV,Rubbery: I was so excited for carb free.  I made the noodles and they were terrible.  I would never recommend these.  They are chewy and have no flavor.,1
A38VB84F0KU1HC,I used the thin ones for pho and they were a perfect replacement. As for the larger flat noodles they ...: I didn't realize this came with a few variations of noodles. I used the thin ones for pho and they were a perfect replacement. As for the larger flat noodles they are a bit too chewy for me.,3
A37V1T6C4GRNIS,"slimy: just not my thing. really did try to make them edible. no matter what you do they are still somewhat slimy and tough to chew, otherwise the flavor isn't bad since they basically taste like whatever sauce you serve them in.",2
AJIU2P2SHMEM5,... without liquid and some turned black - it was disgusting: SOme were dry and without liquid and some turned black - it was disgusting,1
A2CX8JAVBLVTAV,"They're like those rubbery Chinese noodles: These have no flavor eaten plain. But cook them up with whatever and you're in for a no-calorie, delightful treat. They're like those rubbery Chinese noodles.",5
AQI6Y4EV4JD7C,"Made me sick: First off, I had no issue with the initial smell or the texture.  That being said...

EDITED

Everything I said about this could attributed to the very strong allergic reaction I had to this product.  I ended up making a trip to the ER, being put on steroids, and being miserable for more than a week.  I spent days weak as a kitten, dizzy like I was drunk, and had elevated blood pressure.  You probably won't have the same experience but I advise caution.  It left me horribly sick and feeling as if I would die.  But again, that's my personal experience which is why I've edited this review to reflect that.  I'm keeping the one star as it reflects my experience.

Finally feel somewhat normal again after a week, still not 100% yet.  My review is very negative but I had a very strong reaction to this stuff.  If you are sensitive to some vegetables, fruits, and eggs like I am you definitely want to take caution when trying this product.  A shame, I could see myself getting a lot of mileage out of these as I seem to be the only negative reviewer who didn't have an issue with the smell and texture.",1
A1MO7ERE6X74JE,"Simply stunning replacement for any of the asian translucent noodles - no calories, no carbs, no gluten!: No carbs? Correct!
No gluten? Right again!
No calories!!!!???? That's what the nutrition label says.
All fiber? Nothing but high quality fiber? Yes!

This is just about the only pasta you can take to a party and hope that most can eat it. As for me? Unlimited portions! All you can eat! It's good for me!

Oh rats! I forgot my diet is so restricted my stomach shrank.

Is there a fishy odor?
Yes, it's there when you drain the noodles for the first time. Give it a rinse with water and you're good. This particular brand is less fishy than the full blown Japanese konnyaku but even that ain't bad. There is no odor after put them in soup or a cooked up into a dish. Hot water will deodorize the noodles. For this brand, you can soak the noodles in hot tap water (mine is 127 deg F) for 2 minutes, drain, and soak again in hot tap water for another 2-3 minutes. If you use the full blown black Japanese shirataki, you do need to blanch in boiling water for about 3-5 minutes for full deodorization.

The noodles look very similar to rice noodles (think pad thai) but not so sticky. Also, they resemble glass or cellophane noodles only not so slippery.  You can serve them just like the rice or cellophane noodles.

Since there is no carbs or gluten - Hallelujah!  Let the partying begin!

Guilty pleasures ramen soup

Broth - highest quality you can find
1 package of Miracle noodles
suitable leftovers (stir fried asian cabbages, eggplant, hot peppers always!, watercress, left over bits of meat, eggs...)

Rinse noodles. Boil broth and then add noodles. Add leftovers. Let boil again. Serves one insomniac.

Lindy's dirt simple sesame noodles - this is basically an Asian-style pasta salad. It's very free form. You get to adjust all the amounts.

Ingredients (serves about 8 at a party - unless they are vegetarians, figure 4)

For the dressing
Sesame seed oil (the dark stuff0
Soy sauce (get the XO - the good stuff)
Vinegar (if you can find it - get the cane sugar - it's the most Chinese-y)

About 4 packs of Miracle Noodle or Konnyaku
2-4 cups Mung bean sprouts - rinsed
4 scrambled eggs (use water) - if you feel energetic then fry up the eggs into sheets, roll up then, slice into long strands
about 2 cups green onions, sliced 1-2"" long

If you feel the noodles are too fishy, then blanch them. The truth is the dressing will cover any odor.  Toss the ingredients together. Dress with the sesame oil, soy sauce and vinegar to taste. The dressing will cause the noodles to lose water. If you are making this ahead, you will need to rebalance the dressing later.  Serve with something that people can grip like bamboo chopsticks or grippy tongs.

Lazy Days at the Beach Salad
1 pkg Miracle Noodles - drained and deodorized
Japanese seaweed salad - usually kelp, sesame seeds and sesame oil (found at your local Asian market or sometimes Costco) - about 2oz
Your choice of fish - I usually go for canned salmon or sardines, but you can get fancy and add slivers of fish OR just serve the fish on top of the salad.
Soy sauce, vinegar (apple cider for the probiotics), sesame seed oil, toasted sesame seeds or flaxseeds

Add the noodles, the seaweed salad and any other ingredients to a bowl. Add sesame/flax seeds, soy sauce, vinegar and sesame oil to taste and toss. Top with the fish.",5
A1AQOYYMSRB051,"Very bad, not recommended.: I don't like it at all. I bought it because of the ""miracle 0 calories"" and I thought I could be a good substitute for high carb pasta or rice. I doesn't smell (only at the beginning, when you open it, it smells really bad, like a dead fish) after being cooked, it doesn't taste.

My only issue with them is that they are incredibly expensive.",4

A3PRY4QBLH6XTU,"These had a lot of good reviews so I figured: These had a lot of good reviews so I figured, what the heck, I'll try them. Lesson learned.

When the box arrived I was excited to try. Like everyone says there is a terrible smell. Not fishy. It smelled like the air that comes out of a bike tire. Nasty. Stinks. I followed the preparation directions in the Miracle Noodle website. Rinse, boil, dry roast, and add sauce. I've been a restaurant cook for 20 years so I'm pretty comfortable in the kitchen.

The smell dissipated but was still there. I prepared an incredible Italian red sauce to go with them. I tossed the squeaky noodles in the sauce, topped with a little Pecorino & Parmesean and took a bite. Bad. So bad.

These things were like rubber. I literally couldn't bite through them. It tasted like eating a bowl full of rubber bands, both in flavor and texture. No joke, I literally gagged and poured the entire plate into the trash. There's no way I can imagine these being good at all. Under no circumstances would I ever buy these again. I think they're zero calories because you cannot eat them.",1

A232LPNOG3W5PY,Five Stars: Great product.,5
A2116409CY9ZO9,"Great Product, if you follow instructions: The packaged noodles are suspended in liquid.
When opened up, these smell like fish.  Dump the packet into the colander and rinse, rinse, rinse.  One package is a girl sized helping.

Dump into lightly salted boiling water.  Boil for 5 minutes and drain in colander.

At this point, you can serve (but the noodles will release some water and dilute the sauce), or put back in the pan with spaghetti sauce (released water will boil off).

Serve with low carb pasta sauce, mushrooms, giardiniera, parmesan or romano cheese
OR
Just butter and parmesan or romano cheese
OR
clam sauce
OR
Melted cheese sauce

But never by themselves.

Finally, these noodles form tangles that make them difficult to handle.  I always cut them up before eating.",4

They do have an oddly fishy odor out of the package (there's no fish in it), but that rinses off quite well under running water. They are somewhat rubbery in texture. Honestly, if I didn't have a specific reason to avoid starch, I probably wouldn't use them. But being on carbohydrate restriction, I'm very happy indeed to have *something* I can enjoy that's noodle-like. Great with tomato sauce, and the rice-style is nice in chicken soup.

Pro:  Zero calorie food.  That's right, zero calorie food.  Also no carbs.  And they replace pasta, which has lots of both with no real nutritional value to add.

Cons:
1.  Price.  About ten times the cost of pasta but sill only about $2 per serving.
2.  Preparation.  More complicated than pasta, but easy after the first time and takes about the same amount of time overall.
3.  Smell.  There is odor right out of the bag, but it goes away, so no big deal unless you are particularly sensitive.
4.  Taste.  I have these under heavy meat sauce and I detect no taste.  Even when  you eat them plain they are bland in a good way, but not as tasty as pasta.

Garlic salt and pepper, saute until the onion starts to brown. I use the onion color as an indicator because I have never been able to get this ""rice"" to brown.

Even as an experienced Asia traveller, I was quite appalled by this product. It's never a good start if the contents of the package smell like rotting fish and the instructions tell you to rinse thoroughly. I cooked (rather heated) them in a concentrated broth, hoping to impart taste.

No luck: these ""noodles"" don't take up any flavor from the cooking liquid. The texture of these is almost crunchy and the fishy taste doesn't go away - the result tastes like something between fried jellyfish or sea cucumber. (Yep, tried both.)

I made two changes in preparation methods and now I can say these are most certainly edible for me, which is great. I googled ""dry fry miracle noodles"" and found lots of suggestions. One I read said to rinse the noodles well, drain well, snip them up into smaller pieces with scissors, then dump them into a nonstick pan and gently tossing for about 8 minutes. This sounded like a long time to me, but the noodles didn't seem to crisp up or burn in the process. I turned the heat way down then added salt, then a giant whop of pesto, tossed in some walnut pieces and shaved parmesan and let it sit for another minute. Slid it onto a plate and it looked beautiful, did not smell of fish, and filled me up completely. The dry frying seemed to eliminate some of the intolerable odor for me, and snipping them up reduced the chance that a noodle would get semi-swallowed and stuck with one end down my throat and the other in my mouth. That sensation about killed me when I tried them way back when. The texture is still a bit rubbery, but I found them very satisfying. Glad I tried again.",4
A3H6QJ1ONB6271,"Amazon ruined the product by freezing it!: I didn't have any problems with my first order. As soon as I opened this one, I knew there would be issues. This product is not meant to be frozen, just refrigerated.  Half of the shipment was frozen. When I opened the noodle packets that were frozen, the noodles were no longer viable for consumption.  Only half of my order survived the freezing and was edible.  The others I had to toss. What a waste!",2

A37PZ40SRS3W3V,"Awesome Pasta Substitute: For a traditional pasta substitute, these are awesome. They are certainly more expensive than traditional pasta, but each pack is plenty for a very filling one-portion meal.

For those who have complained about the smell and/or taste, I assume they have not followed the instructions properly. They do have a very undesirable smell when you first open the pack - somewhat akin to fish, as someone already mentioned (as weird as that sounds). However once you rinse them in cold water for about 15 seconds, the smell significantly goes away. It completely disappears after boiling in water (as instructed) on the stove. After boiling for two minutes or so, I rinse them once more in a strainer and then put back in the pot I boiled them in and place it back on the burner (on medium heat). Leave them on the stovetop, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes and you are all set to add them with your favorite sauce.

Texture is still not 100% like traditional pasta, but very, very close and when prepared properly, the noodles are not slimy at all (as one reviewer stated). I will definitely be keeping these on hand.",5

A2KXBMET7I43WQ,"Pick your sauces carefully: First I would like to say pasta is my favorite food ever, specifically creamy pastas. Unfortunately creamy pastas haven't been nice to my waistline so it was time to cut them out of my diet. These don't taste like pasta, but rather a vegetable. Almost like a cooked green bean texture, with a little bite. It will take on the flavor of whatever sauce you pour on it. I made the mistake of pouring fat free cream of mushroom on it, which ruined the whole dish because it had that ""diet"" after taste which I hate. I ended up throwing half the dish out solely because of that diet cream sauce. I do not blame the miracle noodles. The next day I decided to try again but with a meat sauce (prego). Another person mentioned the best way to prepare the noodles for better results is to first rinse, drain and then microwave for 2 minutes. Do this twice. Then the noodles are ready to be used. I quickly heated up the sauce in the microwave (2 minutes) then poured the noodles in the sauce bowl. I microwaved the whole thing for another 3 minutes. I had my first bite and it was delicious! The noodles took on the pasta sauce taste and was great! My entire meal was only 210 calories vs. 600 calories for a normal pasta dish. These do make you full very fast. You will only need to make one bag with whatever recipe you use them in if it's a single serving for yourself. I think I'll try an alfredo next.",5

A1LFS2Q07KQJ7I,"Learn about the product and follow the directions!: First, the final result is more like Asian ""rice noodles"" (e.g. as you might eat in Pad Thai) rather than noodles made of wheat and eggs. If your mouth is expecting Italian-style pasta, then yes - you will be disappointed. As I eat a fair amount of pan-Asian food with transparent noodles, so I wasn't the least bit disappointed by the texture of the Shritaki noodles. And yes, the water in which these noodles are packaged does smell strongly like ""fish"" (actually, more like shrimp). No, that doesn't mean they're ""spoiled"", and YES, the smell goes away with rinsing. I rinse and pan-dry the noodles before cooking as many, many others have counseled.

The end result is that I can enjoy a noodle dish, *any* kind of noodle dish (not just Chinese), without carbs, gluten, or wheat grain being added by the noodles. For those on a low-carb diet or who cannot eat wheat products, this is a genuine treat. I get really tired of having a tiny universe of food I can eat; Shritaki noodles help me expand that universe tremendously. As many others have said, what you taste is the sauce; what you experience (as I said) is very, very similar to rice-based transparent noodles.

I believe pretty much all of the 1-star reviews were written by people who failed to do any research before purchase. Google is your friend.",5

I tried making them like spaghetti and adding marinara sauce, and the results were that the noodles had no taste at all which isn't a horrible thing.  I am not saying I would eat these all of the time, but they are fast and easy to make for lunches that are very low in carbs.  I think they may be better with an Asian inspired sauce so I may try that next time.

So when I eat it, I need to add heavy taste sauce to cover the wired taste of the noodle. (something like chili?) It DOES taste better then. And a very good part part I like is that this noodle will make me feel like I really eat enough food. I do not feel hungry any more after I had one bag of this noodle. So I believe it should be very helpful if you are one a diet and want to loose some weight. So I think it is great for its zero cal. and the weird taste can be covered. Recommend it!

A2AM1YT13KFHT5,"Awesome pasta substitute for those who can't have carbs!: I have no complaints about this product. I really could not have been happier! I have a lipid disorder that restricts me from eating carbs (esp. refined), & before my diagnosis, I was all but a carb addict. Giving up pasta was horrible/terrifying & I was desperate to find a replacement. In the grocery store, I had picked up some tofu shirataki & was pretty pleased, but was very curious to try these ""guilt free"" noodles. I am SO glad I decided to try them.

While I absolutely LOVE this product, it is very, very important to note that it is NOT just like regular angel hair. The prep is very different as is the texture, but if you can't have pasta like me, this product gives you the sensation you're looking for while still following doctor's orders. The texture has a little more of a bite, almost like biting rubber or a very al dente noodle, but it's not strange if you're prepared for it to be different than traditional pasta. It's all in the prep. If you prepare the noodles as instructed on the package, they'll turn out just fine. The fluid the noodles are packed in DOES have a fishy odor. It's not fetid, just don't breathe out of your nose for a minute or directly sniff the product.

I prep slightly differently than instructed on the package: Rinse for at least 1 minute in a colander. I then dehydrate mine slightly in a frying pan to release any of the fluid that may have been absorbed into the noodle. Then, I rehydrate the noodles (still in the frying pan) with culinary chicken stock or whatever pasta sauce I'm using.

They're incredibly versatile, too. Like I said, I'll rehydrate them with chicken stock, which gives them a nice flavor & just add vegetables. I love it prepared as a traditional pasta dish, too. The noodles themselves are flavorless and will take on the flavor of whatever you cook them in.

TRY THESE. You won't be disappointed as long as you understand that, they ARE NOT THE SAME AS REGULAR NOODLES. DO NOT BUY THEM IF YOU ARE EXPECTING TRADITIONAL ANGEL HAIR PASTA. THE PRODUCT IS DIFFERENT. But sometimes different is good, especially for someone like me! Definitely recommend for those with lipid disorders, gluten allergy/intolerance, diabetics, etc.",5

As someone who is watching her daily calorie intake and having occasional carb and pasta cravings, this could not make me happier. For a while I made zucchini noodles with a spiraliser, which was okay, but clearly not the same as actual noodles and not as satisfying. And believe it or not, one medium zucchini is 33 calories vs Shirataki noodles' 05 calories. Spaghetti squash is also a nice noodle alternative, but it's a lot of hard work! With shirataki noodles, the slightly rubbery, chewy texture is not too different from several types of Asian noodles I am already familiar with so I have no issue there.

I've been gluten-free for almost 17 years, so the thought of giving up more foods was abysmal. However, that's reality, and I'm venturing into new food territory to keep myself from getting bored with it all. These noodles are a great addition.

I didn't find their odor offensive. They do smell unusual out of the packet, but they've got nothing on various fermented fishes I've smelled. I followed the package directions by rinsing, boiling in broth, then pan drying them. With a bit of kimchi, chicken, and coconut aminos, they were very tasty. Granted, they had virtually no flavor on their own, but I'm fine with that. After years of trying to make gluten-free pasta work and it disintegrating or tasting odd, I'm fine with flavorless. The texture of the shiratake noodles is firm but, like al dente, though no gummy or slimy like gluten-free pasts can be.

At $13 with subscribe and save, these come out to a little over $2 per serving. That's not outrageous for one person. If I had to feed a family with these, it would not be something I could indulge, often. As it's just me, I'm good with having them every now and then. They are, however, cheaper from my local market. What's available there is a different brand, and they are an 8oz package. I'm happy I tried these, though I will likely buy the variety.",5

AFK8MTZDOQTNC,"returned!: I bought these for my diet and before they came from Amazon, I found them at my local grocery store and tried them. They tasted horrible so when my Amazon order arrived, I returned it. This is not a product I recommend unless you don't mind the taste and smell of fish. No matter how much I rinsed them, the smell was still there.",1
A37ZIJIB5GG4IB,"but they are pretty close! If you are a Weight Watchers member ...: No, these noodles and rice don't have the EXACT same texture and taste as the real thing, but they are pretty close!  If you are a Weight Watchers member they are ZERO points!  Usually pasta and rice is pretty high in points (6 points for a cup), but you can have as much of these as you want for zero points.

I made the fettuccine noodles with a regular pasta sauce.  It was pretty good, but what I really liked was using the angel hair noodles and rice in a chicken stir-fry.  They absorb the flavors of the teriyaki and soy and have a good texture for that dish.

There are a couple extra steps to preparing these noodles.  They come packaged in a liquid that smells a little stinky when you open it.  The company warns you about the smell on the back of the package and the noodles DO NOT taste like the smell at all.  You drain the liquid, and then you have to rinse the noodles with cool water for 10 seconds, boil them in water for 2 minutes, and then ""dry"" them in an oil free pan on the stove.

I think these noodles are worth the few extra steps to enjoy guilt free ""pasta"" and ""rice"".  I will definitely be ordering more.  My only complaint is that they are much more expensive than just regular rice or pasta.",5

They are prepared like you would prepare tofu. They are packaged in water and you need to get rid of that. Cook without oil in a nonstick skillet till dry. Don't worry they don't stick like pasta.

It's got a long shelf life when stored properly and is much faster to cook up (even following all the instructions for rinsing/soaking/pan frying) than regular rice.  It's an essential part of my low-carb pantry.",5

AL8IC1LPP546J,"Im in love!: I had no idea this product existed until I started the Dukan Diet, and it was among the allowed foods. Went online to check, and found not so good reviews among some really good ones, so I was a little skeptical. Today it arrived and I already tried two different recipes, both delicious. It might be because I have been for four days on protein only,but it tasted just like pasta to me. First, I did the angel hair baked and crispy, which was great, although one package turned into a very small portion. Then I did the fettuccini and it was awesome, already subscribed to regular delivery. I cannot believe this is a zero calorie food. I followed the instructions, rinsing it very well (it does have a bad smell at first), then boiled it for four minutes and used the same pan where I had cooked steak (no oil and lots of seasoning), with a little bit of fat free sour cream, then tossed the steak on top. OMG I could eat this every day of my life! I was dying for some carbs, and these noodles did the job. Amazing! I guess the secret is to be creative when adding taste to it. In love!",5

A10WQPR3TCGP1Y,"Have reasonable expectations, and you might just love them.: Like so many, I'm doing a low carb diet. (And it's working fabulously, yay!!) I craved noodles, though. Heard about these, read the reviews, and tried them. Love 'em. Everyone else has said it already, so I'll just reiterate a few points:
1) Have reasonable expectations. They're zero calories, zero fat. Do you really expect it to taste like the pasta you miss so much? C'mon. It's a substitute, but it's more psychological than anything.
2) Follow the directions EXACTLY. If you do that, I've found they turn out beautifully. They may be multi-step directions, but it's actually quicker to prepare than regular pasta. Each step is very short.
3) My personal favorite way to season them is with a bit of high quality, fresh olive oil*, salt & pepper, and garlic. Mmmm!

*Off-topic hint: If you haven't tried fresh olive oil versus the not-so-fresh kind most of us buy, try it. I recently switched. The taste difference is amazing, and apparently the nutritional value of olive oil is much higher the fresher it is. Do a little research online and you can probably find a brand that's known for freshness at your local supermarket. A harvest date on the bottle is a good indication it's a brand worth investigating.",5

I only wish I could make them a little more tender, they had a little bit of a bite to them, but this was my first time making them, so maybe I need to cook them longer.

I ate an entire package in one setting.  Things were fine until about six hours later.  I was lying in bed when my fianc heard the first rumblings of what was to come.  An audible growl came from stomach.  Not a hunger growl, but something more ominous.  More terrifying.  The second growl was even louder and my fianc actually saw my stomach noticeably shift.  Excitement and terror simultaneously gripped me after hearing and feeling the chaos that the shirataki noodles were inflicting on my colon.  Part of me worried that the slightest sneeze or laugh could trigger a loss of control, ruining our sheets.  But the adventurous part of me wanted to see where this thing went.

An hour later, it happened.  I tested the bounds of our newly installed Toto toilet, and was thoroughly impressed.  You could set off a pipe bomb in that toilet and it wouldn't crack.  The aftermath was quick and, without going into too much detail, I had to go onto webMD because I was worried I had worms.  Nope, just proof that shirataki noodles cross over whole.",4

Open the package and throw them in a small colander to rinse and drain them.  You will probably notice the fishy smell, so I suggest you already have running water to rinse them out in.  Using your fingers, separate the noodles while rinsing. I then use apple cider vinegar or white balsamic vinegar to sprinkle over the noodles and then rinse again.  Drain them very well (if you like...dry them on a piece of paper towel before adding to your prepared dish).  I always add these noodles last to my dishes and cook for a minute or two while tossing to mix all the flavors.  I suggest starting with this variety pack so you can start with the ""rice"" or ""angel hair"" textures first.
I personally had never tried the rice and was pretty amazed that I like it almost as much as rice (I did use the micro wave to heat them for a minute and then tossed them into my prepared garlic/mushroom/veggie mix.  Pretty darn good and filling.",4

I can't eat this stuff, but my husband thinks it's pretty great. Still, some will get the hang of cooking it and find some recipes that disguise the taste well. Try it once for sure!

My husband likes the angel hair noodles best, and has had success cooking them this way: First, drain and rinse the noodles really really well. Next, use kitchen shears to cut the noodles a couple of times so they're not stuck in one giant blob. Throw them into boiling water for a couple of minutes and then move them into a dry frying pan where they need to cook for about 10 minutes (at this point they make a really strange sound as they dry out).

A2S7WX4DCUS20W,"Miracle Noodle Shirataki Rice: This is my third time ordering this product. I have tried the fettuccini, angel hair, and rice varieties. I like all of them, but rice is my favorite. I found I prefer to substitute zucchini or carrot ""noodles"" for the fettuccini and angel hair. But, I use the rice for stir fries and similar dishes where there is no vegetable equivalent stand-in.

This is a great substitute for those pasta dishes forbidden on a low-carb diet. I have lost 30 pounds, since May, following a low-carb eating plan that includes Miracle Noodle Shirataki Rice. I usually have it about once or twice a week.

Here's a tip to help with the smell. I always rinse the product well under cold running tap water for a few minutes. Let the water drain, then I dump it from the colander to a container with a lid. Now cover it with chicken or beef broth. Make sure it's all submersed. Put the lid on, and park it in the fridge for at least a few hours....preferably overnight. You can add a garlic clove or a small slice of onion for flavor. The noodles/rice absorb the flavor of the broth, and the fishy smell disappears.

After the soak, drain and continue cooking as usual. Boil, fry, etc.

My only complaint, why I down graded to four stars...wish it was cheaper, or the packages were larger. One package is about a serving size for an average adult eater.",4

Instead, season them with whatever spices you like (e.g., salt, pepper , curry powder, etc.) and then dry fry them in a wok for 5 to 10 minutes.  Finally, the package contents has a fishy smell when you open it.  Don't worry, it does not contain fish.  You just have to rinse thoroughly and it washes the smell away.",5

I've never found a sushi I could tolerate either, so this isn't surprising.  Some people find this excellent, however.

Rubber and fish. You do really have to rinse them. I gave only three stars because the Nasoya noodles have very little odor and do not seem as slimy. Also, these are not cut all all the way through, so if you want a more elbow macaroni type noodle, you have to cut these yourself a bit. I have noticed that all shirataki noodles are one..big... long...noodle. I probably won't buy these again because they do stink to high heaven and I am able to get shirataki that is not nearly as offensive. Some people are not nearly as offended by the smell, so I guess it is just a matter of odor tolerances.

The RICE is equivalent to tapioca - I won't be getting this replication in the future.

The ANGEL HAIR has the feel of regular al dente spaghetti, however chewing them is different. They are more soft and with a slight rubber  when you chew on them. Will buy this ""noodle"" replication again.

It's not rice; despite the name, don't think of it as rice. Some sort of pasta-like description might be more apt. In Japanese cuisine, you see this used in Sukiyaki and a few other common dishes. It won't stick to itself, and it actually won't go well with quite a few things I usually associate with rice (butter,salt&pepper; natto; as a base for a stir fry -- it won't work for these.)

However, it works extremely well when scrambled with eggs or tossed with steamed vegetables. In both cases, a little mirin and soy sauce make a great addition.",5

Opened the bags and dumped them in the strainer while cold water was running. Rinsed then for a few minutes, then let them drain fod a few minutes.  Now here is the tricky part. I watched several youtube videos and the people that seemed to like them best said not to boil them but to drain really well and dry cook them in a frying pan (non stick ).  That's wgat I did. Over med-med low for about 6 minutes (pan was already hot). Used tongs to move them around, no sticking or clumping. Thru the alfedo sauce over the top.  I loved it.

A162S75UMDTC,"surprisingly decent: I first heard about these Shirataki noodles on an episode of BEGIN Japanology dealing with potatos:  [LINK]

Seemed too good to be true - a food product that's almost entirely fiber, with no real caloric content?  I had to try them out.

To start with, I misunderstood the labeling.  I thought that one of the styles was a ""rice noodle"" style.  That isn't true.  It's actually a ""rice"" style.  They're little bits that vaguely resemble rice.  The other two styles are ""angel hair"", which resembles a spaghetti noodle; and ""fettuccine"", which resembles a spaghetti noodle.

I incorporated the ""angel hair"" style into a chicken stir-fry I was making.

In researching how to best utilize these noodles I saw several people remarking on a ""fishy"" smell...  I was really expecting more when I opened the bag, but my kitchen was not immediately flooded with the aroma of fish.  I did notice, however, a distinctly pungent smell when I got my nose down close to the open bag.  It reminded me more of vinegar, or rubber, or latex paint.  Sharp and astringent.  Not reminiscent of food, but not entirely unpleasant.

After rinsing the noodles with cold water for about 10 minutes, there was absolutely no discernible odor at all.  They just smelled like cold water.

I boiled the noodles very briefly, then added them to a pan with some of the sauce I was using.  I sauteed them for a few minutes, then incorporated them into the stir fry.  And they were surprisingly decent.

They didn't have the nice doughy consistency of real noodles.  They didn't taste like wheat pasta.  But they weren't objectionable either.  They added a nice bit of texture and variety to the stir fry, and they basically just tasted like the stir fry sauce.  They were very al dente, very firm and a little chewy.  Not what I'd normally expect from a noodle.  Almost more like meat or seafood in consistency.

My wife didn't like the texture.  She opted to eat around the noodles.  I found them to be a nice contrast to the rest of the stir-fry and thoroughly enjoyed them.  I look forward to trying out the other varieties.",4

The noodle have no taste and the texture of al dente pasta. It absorbs the flavors of the sauces nicely.",4

AUAUTDU8B2YJN,"Intrigued and surprised: I didn't fully know what to expect, but I had read some reviews so I at least knew these had to be rinsed well. Oh boy did they. The liquid they (i tried the angel hair first)come in smells really gross, kinda fishy in a bad way. After rinsing for the recommended 20 seconds, the smell mostly went away, but not totally. I was hopeful that the marinara and toppings would cover the rest of the smell. I heated them up with the sauce in the microwave. I was a little surprised by the texture,  it's more rice noodle meets bean sprout than pasta in texture. The smell from the liquid did not carry over to the meal, but I should have patted the noodles dry, as they held water from the rinsing and watered my marinara sauce down too much.

All in all, though it's not quite pasta, it's a pretty decent substitute. It serves its purpose as a bland base and carrier for pasta sauce. I'm very intrigued by these noodles and a bit anxious about the rice since I imagine rinsing then won't be nearly as easy as rinsing the noodles were and I don't expect to be able to eat them plain like real rice.  Will try to remember to update once I have the guts to try it.",5

I also don't feel bloated like I did before when I ate pasta.  Can't wait to try them in other dishes!!!",5
AOKGBD8P65GIV,"They're just not very good, unfortunately.: I wanted to like these so much. A lot of people say that pasta is just a vehicle for the sauce/ingredients that are being poured over it, and I suppose at some level that's fair, but with something like Miracle ""Noodle"", there is something very different going on.

I didn't find the smell off-putting at all (grow up, everyone, for crying out loud), but I did find the texture off-putting. The worst culprit is the ""linguine"". It's *very* thick, very flavorless, and very elastic-like. Frankly it's just unpleasant. Is it better than having no pasta at all? I'm not sure I can say yes to that question. If someone told me I could never have pasta again, but I could have miracle noodles I think, ultimately, I'd just choose to eat whatever I'd originally planned to put on top of said pasta in to a bowl, and eat it, versus putting it on top of these ""noodles"".",2

I've tried boiling, dry frying, boiling then dry frying, cooking by itself, cooking in broth, cooking in a sauce - doesn't matter it's still disgusting.  We literally can't eat it.  We try it, force ourselves to take a few bites to give it a chance, then end up throwing it away every time.  The consistency is the problem, not the taste.

I tossed it with butter, lemon, fresh basil and cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese, and it scratched the itch. My carb desire for tonight is completely gone.

I heard about these and everyone was raving about them, so I decided to give them a try. Let me start by saying, I LOVE pasta and can eat amounts that just aren't human. These noodles sounded like they would be a great substitute.

They do smell funky when opened, but rinsing well took care of that. They were easy enough to cook. I tossed the cooked noodles with my favorite pasta sauce and dug in. The taste is sort of like the funky smell when opening the pack. Not quite as strong, but still there. The texture is what really turned me off. Imagine eating thin funky-fishy-flavored gummy worms covered in your favorite sauce.

I did read some tips on how the dry fry them, which is supposed to take some of the moisture out and make them taste and feel more like regular pasta. That didn't help.

I bought these a few months ago out of curiosity - I've considered trying to lose a few pounds. They sat on my shelf for a while and finally we gave them a shot with some homemade spaghetti sauce.

I opened the bag and braced for the worst, but honestly it smelled faintly like an oriental supermarket. I can take that. I rinsed them and blanched them and sauteed them with spaghetti sauce and vegetables.

We were really surprised. They're different, but they have a good consistency. There wasn't a fishy taste at all (even with tomato sauce, which usually makes bad fish taste worse.) They may have been a little watery, and the lumped together like ramen - we're going to try pad thai next time - but they worked.

And there isn't a ""I just ate a big bowl of pasta"" feeling afterwards - even though we both ate a bag ourselves.

A3CUD82H6XWIU0,"Expensive Ramen: I ordered these in part because of claims made about the positive effects of glucomannan on blood sugar, but mainly to satisfy my curiosity about the extreme range of reviews addressing the smell and texture of these noodles.

THE INFAMOUS STENCH: So, the smell definitely is intensely chemical when you open the package. I rinsed them a couple of times in hot water, which didn't remove the smell but did diminish it somewhat. I then ate one plain, and it didn't taste at all weird, so I figured some fragrant seasoning would cover any remaining chemical scent. The noodles absorbed the flavor really well and it seemed just like eating regular Asian-style noodles.

THE ""SINEWY"" TEXTURE: Without even cooking it, the texture was not in the least bit chewy, or ""sinewy"" as some reviewers have claimed. This could be due to the skinniness of the ""angel hair"" variety. It is nothing like angel hair pasta, however. It has a kink to it that is more akin to ramen. Other than the kinky appearance, the whiteness and general texture remind me of pho. Just follow the instructions on the package for cooking, which is pretty much just heating through, rather than boiling them.

My only complaint is that unlike ramen, one package is not that filling, so for the price there's no real comparison to pasta, which is both cheap and filling. But if you just want to eat them for the novelty or for the health benefits, and don't mind paying a lot for a food that is reminiscent of the 20 cent noodles you ate in college, they are not offensive.",3

A6KUOAH2XAR2J,"Game Changer!: I read about these noodles on a keto blog, and oh my gosh. These noodles are a game changer!
The hardest thing for me about going on the keto diet was ending my love affair with pasta. With these noodles, I can have my cake and eat it too!

When you first open the package, there is a faint smell but it isn't overwhelming. After rinsing, boiling, and cooking, that smell is completely gone. They have a neutral taste which doesn't interfere with whatever sauce they are added to. Some people say they are chewy, but I love the texture. It reminds me of al dente noodles, which is how I prefer my pasta anyway. So, these are perfect for me.

Even if I weren't on the keto diet, I'd probably still use these noodles over regular noodles. That's how much I like them! I've lost 25lbs so far, and plan to lose much more!

AWFSTV5LU10AO,"Tasty, tastier than the plain: Delicious. I even shared a package with a friend who was looking to try them.
My advice on using these:
Unless your dish requires a fishy flavor, rinse these well under cold water before cooking.
As others have suggested, par-boiling them first is a good start. Do it this way:
add some olive oil to the water, because it's delicious and good for you and helps the noodles not clump together.
The noodles are a tangly mess and they are hard to get apart once you've started cooking, so separate them and drop them into the boiling water a few at a time. The Olive Oil will help keep them from clumping back together.
I've also tried just going at the clump with kitchen shears before dropping it into the water, but that's timne consuming.

As always, these noodles have a rubbery texture compared to your run of the mill wheat pasta. I think it's similar to calamari, but thinner. If you go in expecting the texture, your brain won't short circuit on you. If you fail to think about it, then you won't enjoy your meal, and shouldn't we at least enjoy ourselves when trying to eat healthy?",5

A437V8QIIXBZJ,"An OK product for carb watchers.: Like rice, this is a tasteless substitute with a fraction of carbs found in rice.

I didn't like the consistency of smushy, but that was nothing compared to the smell of them that I just couldn't get over. Terrible fishy smell that I couldn't get rid of. Maybe some like them. I read the reviews, but I always like to be positive when it comes to low carb products.",1

I tried the angel hair noodles last night. After rinsing them under cool water for a minute or so, I put them in boiling water a couple of minutes. I drained them, then added the noodles to a simmering pan of low-carb alfredo sauce and topped it with some extra parmesan.  I REALLY liked them, though next time I will let them be in the boiling water an extra minute or so, as they were a bit too al dente for me.  I bought the variety pack, and look forward to trying the two other varieties.",5

No smell what so ever . some people say they spell like fish well they smell like shrimp to me but just a little and it goes away completly if you cook them like I do.

I am trying to replace carbs with foods that are healthier, but my real downfall is pasta, I love, love, love it!  After reading reviews, many of them favorable, I thought to give them a try.  The odor, which many complained about, was not that offensive, though to be honest, it really never went completely away.  I could have lived with that, it was the texture that got to me.  Very slimy/crunchy, similar to seaweed salad (which I love) and totally unappealing as a pasta replacement, at least for me.  Sauces did not cure that problem, so I will continue on my quest for alternatives.",1

These noodles are light and fluffy, come in a liquid so all I need to do is toss them in a strainer while rinsing them with hot water, shake dry, pour on my sauce, and they're ready to eat. They microwave well also.
I have no stomach issues after eating these noodles.  I like the rice, angel hair, and fetuccini so much that i have subscribed to these for regular delivery every month.",5
A205HORNJZD72A,"Best non-gluten, non-wheat, non GMO pasta: I started the Keto diet over the summer and resigned myself to never have pasta again.  Keep in mind, I am someone who, when they did eat pasta, it was homemade using my Grandmother's recipe or high-end organic, fresh made pasta.  I did not have high hopes for this product but I assumed if I put lots of olive oil or butter that it would become edible.  I followed the directions on the miracle noodle website and I was shockingly pleased.  Now, this is not my grandmother's pasta or the high-end pasta that I am used to.  However, I will certainly continue to buy this product.  This was really good both in texture and in flavor.  I used the fettuccini and tossed it with a cream and grass fed beef sauce.  The noodles held the sauce just like a real fettuccini would.  There are other directions on how to prepare these noodles but I think it's probably best to follow the website directions.  I will add to my review after I have prepared the rice and the angel hair.  Definitely worth trying if you are avoiding pasta and GMO free products.  UPDATE:  I am still enjoying these ""noodles"".  I have tried all of the varieties now with various sauces and I have not been disappointed.",5

The smell really dissipates and then I toss them with whatever I am making.  Garlic and olive oil; sesame oil and almond butter (try to emulate sesame noodles).

Especially in colder weather, which seems a million years away but will actually be here before we know it.
I make my own pasta sauces, prepare ground turkey, and use this as a pasta piece. We are good to go on calories, carbs, and a version of spaghetti or other pasta dishes that do not kick my blood sugar into space and send me into a coma for a few hours. I make home made pad thai sauce too, low cal, now fat, goes really well wiht thius product and some tofu - or chicken, but I don't mind the tofu in pad that.

The texture is very different from pasta - the miracle noodles have a more rubbery texture similar to calamari. I was able to mask the marine odor by rinsing the noodles and cooking them in a ramen flavor / spice packet. I gave the product three stars because I was aware of these issues (odor / texture) based on other reviews prior to purchasing and the noodles are still a great dieting method. I did feel fuller after eating them, I just couldn't get used to the initial marine odor or the texture.

For that, I took off one star. I did enjoy it though, I made fried rice with it (with veggies, egg, turkey) and was pleasantly surprised. I also used the rice and soaked it in vanilla almond milk that was sweetened with stevia, and topped it with berries- this was a delicious dessert.

I had no troubles with the smell at all. Once I open the pack, I pour everything in a strainer and rinse it under running water. I then place the strainer on top of a bowl and pour boiling hot water over it (these noodles are very durable and will not over cook or over boil), soaking the noodles for a minute or so before rinsing everything off. You can rinse with more boiling water if you can still smell something, but by this point I usually end up with something completely odorless- if anything, there is maybe a hint of something sweet-smelling. This definitely absorbs the flavor of whatever sauce you cook it with. I've made a few great dishes with it, but I won't have it often...you can't really replace pasta.",4

When I opened the package, the smell was vaguely fishy and unappetizing. But I washed them as directed (rinse in cold water for a minute or so, then pop them into boiling water for 2 minutes) and the smell was gone entirely! I tried one plain first, just to be totally sure they didn't taste weird. They're so good! And as far as the texture, yeah it's a little different, but not so much that it takes away from the meal. It's hard to explain. Whereas normal noodles give to your teeth when you bite them, these actually have a bit more substance to Miracle Noodles. They can be chewy if prepared wrong. But it's such a minimal texture difference that it's hardly worth the mention.

And I keep seeing people say you can't use them wherever you'd use normal noodles? But I made a spaghetti dinner with these noodles and it was insanely good. I made spaghetti sauce and turkey meatballs like usual, just substituted these noodles instead. What's even better is that while one package of them isn't many noodles, they're so high in fiber that it's genuinely filling.

I really don't see a reason to ever eat real noodles again. These are delicious, filling, and not too expensive.",5

 I would recomend this to others without a doubt. Its quick and easy to prepare and leaves you feeling full and satisfied without the guilt. And for those trying to keep their weight or blood sugar under control this is a huge problem solver. Pasta and rice without all the empty carbs.

While I must confess to finding its naked appearance rather offputting (it makes me think of creepy sea worms), if prepared according to the directions, you get pasta texture, and you taste only whatever sauce you use on it.  I actually tried this using a little ghee, some Vodka pink sauce and parmesan/asiago cheese, and it was delicious. Once I mixed the sauce in, the pasta was thoroughly coated, so it no longer looked weird at all.  As a bonus, it's also less time and effort than cooking REAL pasta.

A2RFH2KGE2S3JU,"LOOKS LIKE ZOMBIE FLESH, TASTES AMAZING!!!: IN LOVE! I read a lot of reviews about the fishy smell so I traversed the Google to find a way of resolving the stank. Eureka!
This was my first time trying or making these so here's the step by step I followed based on Internet suggestions.
I opened the package, drained the noodles under cold running water FOREVER & then I pan fried/stir fried in my wok. The noodles held their creepy translucency but the high heat dried them out ever so slightly so they could super absorb the zero carb pesto & roasted garlic drizzle I made. TASTED AMAZING!!!
Even my picky kids liked these noodles! My 11 yr old noted the texture was a bit different but they thought the miracle noodles (non-tofu) were legit.

Very satisfied. Now to find a grocery store that carries the because per the googles, they miracle noodles are only about $2 per Baggie at the grocery store.",5
A1X73KKW5D66MC,"If you expect sorcery, you'll be disappointed: Seriously guys, you have to be realistic here. These are not going to be identical to pasta made from wheat flour, that's like expecting baked apples to taste like potato chips. But with the mindset that they are something else entirely, these are great, and being zero-everything pushes them over into the 'miracle' territory.

I couldn't even smell the supposedly revolting odor until I damn near stuck my nose inside the bag, and even then, it's not nearly as bad as other reviews claimed. It's not a nice smell, but it's not nauseating, and it does rinse off. The consistency is chewier than regular noodles, but not to the point of inedible rubberyness. If texture bothers you, the fettuccine was the least so, impossible to distinguish from rice noodles when boiled in a broth. I didn't find them slimy at all, no matter how I prepared them. They're incredibly filling, way more so than regular pasta - I can eat at least three times the volume of normal spaghetti as I could the angel hair noodles, so take that into account portion-wise.

As for cooking, I found they work best in soups, pretty well in stir-fry, and okay-but-not-great in sauce dishes. For the latter, if you get the chance, cook the noodles beforehand and leave them in the fridge overnight covered in the sauce. I've only done this with marinara, but it worked great. They really have no flavor of their own, so you're going to have to put something on them or they'll just taste like unflavored gelatin.

In sum: these miracle noodles are awesome if you take them for what they are, which is not wheat.",5
A1HOUGUQN91G2J,"Un-usual but Perfect: these were absolutely delicious for not being actual pasta , the rice was more like chopped spagettie but they were all actually great when used for sides with vegetables or as a mayonaise pasta salad with chicken or tuna.",5
A33KT18XS878SG,"LOVE these. For those complaining about the smell: LOVE these. For those complaining about the smell, wash them with white vinegar and rinse before you cook.

A2YVJHW4CXDFP1,"Like rice, but not. :): I've bought and loved most of the miracle products, but I have to say the rice is my favourite. I won't say it is the real thing, but since rice is my absolute favourite food, just that similar mouth feel made cutting carbs a workable thing for me.

First, you absolutely have to rinse them. Lets be real, they do stink,a smell that is a fishy odor mixed with chemicals.  Once they're rinsed, I throw them in a dry pan and dehydrate them for a while as I chop up some veggies.

I usually stir fry some chicken and veggies into the miracle rice, cook for a while with a tiny bit of oil, and then dump in some water and miso paste. It's lovely.

I won't say I'll never go back to rice, but I sure love this substitute.",5

My husband and I was actually amazed that the texture was good, not sticky. They did have a tad smell when I first opened the package but it was the liquid that they were in and once washed off with cool water for 10-15 seconds it went away. The package said to boil the noodles for a few minutes... I did it the first time, but the second time I didn't worry about that step. I went ahead and put them in the un oiled skillet and dried them out and then added them to my recipe. We had spaghetti Keto style for the first time in months. We use Raos Homemade spaghetti sauce it is very low in carbs and very tasty too. It can be pricey. So here is my pros and cons.....

I cooked up a cheesy sauce for a different dish and kept a couple scoops aside.

I rinsed well, then put the noodles into a pan to ""dry"" them out a bit, then rerinsed and reheated in the pan.  added my sauce and some gluten free Italian meatballs, then dug in. the flavor was amazing!  I mean, they're chewy like shirataki noodles are, but seriously, the flavor!",5

There is a bit of a fishy/brine smell but that goes away with the rinsing.  The noodles take ONE minute to cook.  I put them in a steamer basket and popped in the boiling water.
We mixed them with sweet chili sauce, kale, grilled onions, garlic, and pork loin. Once the noodles were cooked, I followed in the instructions about blotting with paper towel and then mixed them in with our sauce and let them sit for about a minute.

A2H1EY6HK3757M,"Different, but nice alternative to pasta: It took me a while to finally prepare the noodles, because everyone commented on the  fishy smell and I'm not a ""fish person,"" but it is mild..not as strong as cat food. Rinsed and cooked there is no hint of fish. The texture is more chewy than pasta. I have veneers on my front teeth due to bike accident and i could not bite through it with front teeth. So if you are trying to cut carbs, I think you can use this in a lot of ways. If you are a pasta lover, you might be disappointed. Haven't tried the rice yet, but I'm thinking it will be closer to rice than the noodles are to pasta. It is very filling. I now return having tried the angel hair noodles. I drained them, boiled 2 minutes, then simmered with sauted veggies and pasta sauce for 5 minutes. They were very much like rice noodles and were really tender and tasty.

I knew to expect a smell when opening the bag and it is definitely foul but I rinse for a minute under cold water, microwave in water for 2 minutes, repeat, drain and toss in a dry frying pan for a few minutes to dry (all in less time than it would take to bring a pot of pasta water to a boil) and there is absolutely no hint of that smelly brine liquid.  So far I have made a traditional stir fry type dish, another awesome one with peanut butter sauce, and added the rice shape to a homemade chicken soup.  All were absolutely delicious and made for satisfying meals.

AXWL4SP8ZEFH8,"Time & Expense VS no Carbs/Cals: Rinse! Rinse! Rinse!
You can't rinse enough! Make sure you follow the instructions at a minimum.
I rinse the noodles for a full 3 mins in the strainer, then let them soak in luke-warm water 1-2 mins, before then quick shocking them in the boiling water for one min. Then rinsing them for another 2 mins, and placing them on a paper towel to get the excess water out.

They do have a brine/fishy smell when you first open the package. After all the rinsing they taste like nothing, just water, no smell.

Then I let them sit in whatever sauce I'm going to use (30mins) and they absorb the taste of the sauce similar to normal noodles. They just don't have the starchy texture and taste of normal noodles. But the experience itself, for me, is very close to that of normal pasta. So much so I would not care which I was served. (except these have no calories!)

CONS:
1) All the rinsing. Does take a good amount of effort to prep these things
2) Price deff more expensive than normal pasta, you also don't get much in these packages. (2 servings-ish)

3. Dry roast in a pan for approximately a minute, until noodles squeak when moved

Seeing as many online reviews note that these noodles never really have a true pasta-type texture, I decided to make a kung pao stir fry with chicken.  Biting into a noodle was exactly like biting into a large earthworm; the texture was so disgusting I threw away the entire pan I made and all of the unopened packages.  The smell reviews mention is also accurate; when opened, they have a fermented, fishy type smell.  Rinsing for 1-2 minutes does get rid of most of the smell, but cooking them brings it back.

Of course nothing will ever be as wonderful as real pasta or rice but I do like this product very much.",5
A2PLOVMHJKT12B,"hoping the angel hair are a little better.: For those going low carb this is definitely a decent substitute to pasta. I will say that personally I am not the biggest fan of the texture of these. Little too much of a bite and even though I dried them as instructed they get a little slimy with whatever sauce you use. Only tried the fettuccini noodles, hoping the angel hair are a little better.",3
AUB97HQHQ8WFB,Five Stars: Great product,5
AOWLAZ0WVI91V,"Not great, not bad, but useful: Got these today, and tried the rice. The smell out of the bag really is gag-worthy, but once rinsed, boiled, then stir fried, the product was fine. The ""rice"" reminded me more of couscous, but I like couscous. Didn't care for the texture alone, but with a forkful of beef and broccoli it was fine. Since I'm on a carb free diet, I'll tolerate them.",4

On the plus side it killed my craving for pasta",1
A3IZE4CLMYDPT4,I love that they have no carbs: I love that these noodles have no carbs but I cant get my family to eat them because they are too slimy and they have a fishy smell and taste if you don't cook them with seasoning to mask it. I had to stop buying them because no one else in my house would eat them.,3

A2J2O1WVBBQPN6,"Excited to find, but not satisfied: I was very excited to have pasta for my low carb diet. The rice turned out ok. The noodles are so rubbery they won't cut. Serving size is very small but there are no carbs or calories in the angel hair past. Slight fishy smell but goes away after washing. Not satisfied for the price.",1
A2DT8YZF2PP02X,Not for me: I did not like the fishy smell when I opened these. If you like fish you will like them but I do not like the taste or smell of fish. They are packaged very well though.,3

A3OQAZB7AL5YZX,"Thumbs up for a great pasta alternative from the pickiest foodie alive: Reading the other reviews scared me from trying these...after I bought them in bulk......but I tried them and there wasn't any odor, and I rinsed them, and patted them dry-I used them as part of my chicken alfredo dish, and it was perfect for that.  The texture is slightly different than a regular noodle...but then again, they aren't a regular noodle so you have to expect it to be different.  As part of a Low-Carb eating lifestyle, I think they are a great option to have on hand when you are just dying to have some pasta.  I don't recommend these for stir-fry.  Overall, I plan on buying these again, and I'm a very picky food-person.",4
A2R66DJG745VLN,"What do Miracle Noodles and tofu have in common?: Miracle Noodles and tofu both have little flavor untill you mix them with other ingredients. I cook with both. Miracle Noodles have a texture that's similar to a regular rice noodle, but without the carbs and calories. I make a lot of stir frys, and I add a bag to each skillet. They pick up the flavor of the garlic and soy sauce. And although they don't taste like a real noodle, they add the texture and appearance that's missing with low carb (and Paleo) cooking. For best results, hold your breath when you open the bag until you rinse the noodles thoroughly. I have no idea what that odor is all about, but it disappears after rinsing... and it doesn't seem to affect the taste.",4
A1UD1ERXQAGCKG,"it does not taste like regular pasta: Let me start by honestly stating . . . no, it does not taste like regular pasta.  So, I would assume huge pasta lovers may shun - to put it mildly - this product.  However, I'm one who typically likes the sauces that are applied to pastas a bit more.  So for me, this is a winner.

The consistency is a little on the calamari side; however, it is worth the 0 calories, 0 carbohydrates, etc . . . some sacrifices have to be made.  It smells quite fishy upon opening the package that completely goes away after washing and boiling; however, it is worth the 0 calories, 0 carbohydrates, etc . . . some sacrifices have to be made.",5

A3BX3JFHFABLLX,"Don't let the smell scare you!: For anyone who can't consume gluten or prefers a low-carb / low-calorie / gluten-free diet, these noodles are amazing.  I've heard a lot of people complain about the smell (yes, it's awful but after a thorough rinse it is gone). There is no flavor to the noodles themselves, so they pair well with absolutely any dish you would normally prepare with regular pasta. My first meal was fettuccine Alfredo and it was perfect.  I can't wait to try them in stir fry!  I have also heard people complain about the consistency. They are perhaps slightly gummier than regular pasta, but I don't really notice it myself.",5

A1BXJ6JF5BAHWU,"great for what it is: Don't buy this product expecting it to taste just like a regular noodle. It will smell when you open it, but the problem is solved with a quick rinse. Unfortunately they do not arrive hard dry like typical pasta but rather in a heavy, liquid bag, so they are bulky to store. I don't recommend using these in Italian style dishes, but they are great for Asian dishes. For no calories I really like them!",5

A1I3V27PM18LJF,"Surprisingly satisfying: These are great!  I am following the THM style of eating. and these were noodles that were considered on plan. I made spaghetti for dinner and plopped these babies into the sauce while it was cooking to soak up the flavor. That was amazing. Because when the package is opened, it stinks. I rinsed the noodles out really well, the smell didn't go away very well. But after sitting in the sauce for a bit, these were pretty good. The texture is a bit slipper and chewy.

A2XEW5WDKN5AVD,"Joseph Mercola recommended it. I liked it pretty well: I ordered and tried some of this awhile ago because Dr. Joseph Mercola recommended it.  I liked it pretty well, but I also like pasta, so usually I would opt for pasta.  More recently, I injured my foot and was unable to exercise as much as I needed to, so I decided this would be a good way to cut calories in a painless way.  I also like the fact that this is a vegetable, which means it is much more alkaline than pasta.  I hate waking up in the middle of the night with leg pain because I have ingested too much acidic food.  It means I have to get up and take some apple cider vinegar in water which does stop the pain.  It is much simpler and less trouble to eat enough veggies to prevent the pain in the first place. Miracle Noodle has no appreciable calories and lots of fiber.  I feel good after eating this along with my homemade spaghetti sauce.",5

AK59S1UFJ163U,"Lost 20 lbs in 3 weeks.. Haven't been this weight in over 10 years.: I have been telling everyone about these. I have read what other has said and figured I would write my own experience.

The Cons:
They smell bad right out of the package
Are a little pricey if you are eating them with every meal

The Pros:
They take on the flavor of whatever you cook them in.
They fill you up when eaten with a protein.
(They ""supposedly"" absorb 25% of the calories that you eat)
I lost 15 lbs in the 1st 2 weeks

I lost 15 lbs in the 1st 2 weeks and 5 lbs in the 3rd. I have now lost a total of 25 lbs and am maintaining this weight.
I tried Atkins without the noodles but couldn't kick my body into ketosis. This worked!

For the first 2 weeks I would eat:
eggs with noodles
Talapia with noodles
chicken with noodles
Angel hair miracle noodles by itself with a ramen noodle spice pack. (Kinda like ramen noodles).

I would only eat the noodles by themselves after 6pm if I got hungry. I worked.

This is the first time I was able to kick my body into ketosis. I have been pretty excited as I haven't been this weight for over 10 years.

I also found out that there is some, ""good tasting"" low carb bread. 1 to 2 carbs per slice. Can't buy it on Amazon.com but there is stuff out there.
There is also a line of No Calorie, No Fat, No Carb, mayonaise, salad dressing, marinade, sauces, peanut butter and 10 calorie jelly. Amazon does carry some of these.

I have since been eating Low carb ham and tuna fish sandwiches with the no carb mayonaise, low carb bread with spinach and tomatoes. (good times)

I go out on the weekends and eat whatever I want (Love Chinese food) and then eat the rice with whatever I cook during the week.

Hope you try em and get the same results I did.

Would love to hear your success stories.",5
A2C25CAADPLU6X,"YUMMY!: Sooooo yummy and ZERO calories. Okay I admit they take a little getting used to at first but once you get used to it they're fine. I rinse them for 2-5 minutes after opening, then boil them in chicken broth for another 5 min, and then let simmer for 5-10 minutes before straining.

Until seasoned, it is tasteless, very similar to tofu actually. The texture is slightly more gelatinous than real pasta, but not enough to put you off it. Be sure to follow rinsing instructions as there is a smell to the liquid the noodles arrive in. If you know what to expect, and how to prepare this properly, it is amazing.

AMLJAHN05WP7X,Good for low carb diet: It is a product that you need to understand is not a taste substitute for pasta but more of a look substitute. The initial smell is of seafood and texture is that of a rubber band or balloon. I does not really absorb sauces very well so it still tastes like the original impression. That being said I use it as a low carb diet filler.,3
A1WD74J62E4ZUN,"Best noodle substitution ever!: These are fantastic! So far I have made a vegetable noodle dish and a Hungry Girl recipe for alfredo! They were so delicious!  As others have mentioned, the noodles have a bit of a smell but it's not bad. Just drain, microwave, rinse, repeat. Do that a few times and there's no more smell.  I also recommend drying these noodles off when they come out of the microwave otherwise the alfredo sauce recipe can get too much liquid.  The noodle dish I made is in the photo I provided. I actually just made up the dish as I went- it has cabbage, okra, and red onion with an Asian tasting sauce I made out of soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, garlic, and truvia brown sugar.  These noodles taste grey with okra, and I actually tossed them into my skillet with the veggies after draining.  Give these a try at least just because they hold sauce better than spaghetti squash.  Fyi, I'm doing low carb and low calorie. I crave noodle dishes sometimes and these are very satisfying... and super filling!",5

A1321F2D68J3DI,"Miracle Not.: It has no carbs for those who need or desire a pasta replacement. If, however, you plan on eating this you better plan on drowning it is seasonings. I've cooked it to the precise directions on several occasions and find that it cooks up like ""Cartlidge"" there is no other way of describing it. I've added extra sea salt to the water, brought it to a higher boil and extended the boil times by an extra 30 seconds 6 times (total extra time 3 minutes so far) at the same time adding extra skillet time. Here is the part where you need to really pour or shake on your seasonings. If you think you like a little salt or seasoning you will end up eating bland slimy cartilage. So far my advice is to experiment with the boiling to soften it up to your preferred softness, I'm still trying to find that point for me. Then find the right amount of skillet time that will allow the seasonings to fully penetrate the noodle. That is where the really tough part is, getting the noodle fully seasoned enough so it tasty enough to eat. Not just tolerate. If you love cartilage and blandness that is easy to make with the provided instructions.",2
A1SOOGRKQ0301Z,"These are good.: The pasta is good if you mix it in with a healthy choice or lean cuisine.  In fact if you put the whole bag in there, you can get 2 meals out of it.  The pasta is a good consistency to bite, but the noodles are really long and you can't cut them with a fork, so you might not want to eat them in front of anyone.  Also, they look weird, so don't look at them when you eat them.  But they taste good- like nothing, they just absorb the flavor of the healthy choice or lean cuisine or smart one.  Enjoy!",4

A3QBC0QCDOH3IG,"Awesome: The Miracle Rice is way better than the spaghetti. I'll admit, the spaghetti has a texture that isn't desirable. However, the rice is great. I love adding a creamy condensed soup to it and a bunch of veggies and spices and maybe some chicken. Super low calorie and very filling! It's sort of like a risotto in that way. You do have to hand swirl/wash it in a colander for like, ten minutes (two minutes?! ha! I wish!) to get that gross fishy smell out, which is quite tedious. But hey, for that kind of super-filling meal for less than like 200 or 300 calories, you can't beat it.

I've tried dry-frying in a skillet, but I can't get them (or the spaghetti) to dry out like everyone says. I've dried them until they squeak, which is the tell-tale sign they're done, but the squishy/chewy texture is still pretty similar to me. I'll have to try the oven-drying method next.

Also, super expensive. But still. If you're looking for a really filling meal with super-low calories, seriously, get some condensed creamy soup (don't add a lot of liquid to it though) and add it to this and a bunch veggies, spices, and you're good to go. I'd sometimes use two bags at a time.

(The penne is also pretty good!)",5

After doing that, the fishy smell was gone and there was no impact on the taste or smell of the final dish. One thing I will note is that I've ordered these multiple times now, and I think that the fishy smell *may* be a function of their freshness(?), because some I've received had NO fishy smell, whereas others it was very strong. Regardless following the rinsing/drying method I mentioned, the final taste has been the same for all of them. Oh how I'm missed noodle soups, so I use these once or twice a week now.",5

A1OKM7W12YYR3S,"""Miracle Noodle"" Is The Perfect Description: These traditional Japanese noodles are a terrific choice for diabetics looking for alternatives to wheat-based pasta, those on any of the various low-carbohydrate diets currently popular, or anyone who is watching calories.  Shirataki noodles are a natural product which is made from a type of yam (they are not a laboratory invention or a clinical special ""diet"" food) and they have almost no calories, zero carbohydrates, and an effective glycemic index/glycemic load of zero.  The noodles' content is basically water and a soluble dietary fiber called glucomannan.  They take on whatever flavor you serve them with, are delicate, have a smooth, glassy texture, and are great for stir fries.  Preparation is stupid-simple: just rinse them in cold water for 10-15 seconds, then blanch them in hot water for a minute or two (Instead of blanching them I just throw them directly into a stir fry and sautee them with the other vegetables for a couple minutes).

There are two criticisms of this product that I would like to address quickly.  The first criticism is that the liquid that the noodles come packaged in smells fishy.  It smells a little funky but it is not a fishy smell, and after rinsing the noodles properly (for 15 seconds in a sieve under cold water) the odor effectively disappears.  Second, some reviewers have said that the noodles taste rubbery -- a word that implies that the noodles are tough and chewy.  This is not the case.  Texturally they are actually quite delicate, even softer than mung bean noodles, at least as far as the angel hair variety which I am reviewing here.

If you are looking for an alternative to rice or other high-carbohydrate noodles for your Asian dishes, look no further.  This is a truly guilt-free food.  Highly recommended!",5

A24R3C3W8WFV5G,"Surprisingly Edible & Satisfying: Open it, awful smell. Dump into colander and drain. Quick rinse. Dump into bowl and cover with fresh water; add a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice. Let sit for 10-15 minutes. Drain. Presto! ""Rice grains"" are now odorless, firm little pieces of calorie-free goodness, ready for use in nearly any dish where rice is an ingredient.  The secret is seasoning, because it has zero taste to go along with the zero calories. I love to use this ""rice"" in the stuffing for stuffed bell peppers. It works really well in soups. It's a good addition to meatballs. Just make sure you use lots of seasoning (even adding some seasoning to the ""soaking"" water). The rice grains have a texture resembling the toothy-ness of Asian glass noodles, and they don't absorb liquid, so don't try to use as a side dish without lots of prep, sauce, seasonings, etc. to make it tasty. All in all---for zero calories---these are fantastic, and a great help to anyone on a low carb diet. Hooray for this entire line of products!",5

This comes as a shock since there is not supposed to be fish in this product. The ingredients are purified water, Konjac flour, spinach powder and calcium hydroxide. Konjac is also known as konnyaku potato, devil's tongue, voodoo lily, snake palm or elephant yam. Konjac (Japanese name, konnyaku (yam cake) is made into noodles called Shirataki. It is used to create a flour or jelly of the same name. It is used as a vegan substitute for gelatin. After being blanched as directed, the noodles have basically no taste; however they are rather slimy. I couldn't eat them. If vegans can, bless their hearts. If anyone likes slimy green noodles with very little taste, they are only 15 calories per serving so they can't have much nutrition or make you gain weight. I was truly disappointed.",1

A3UXFSD2BX9J6R,"Couldn't get past the texture: I read about this type of pasta substitute on various website, read the reviews, good and bad,  and thought that I would give it a try. I like pasta and was looking for a substitute other than spaghetti squash or zucchini. When it arrive, I was intrigue and excited to try it. I opened the bag and did notice the initial smell, which was a little off putting, but I tried to keep an open mind.
I cooked the angel hair first, thinking it was thin and would be a good starter and not be an overwhelming noodle.
Pros:
-It was easy to cook
-It cooked much quicker than pasta so it is a timesaver
Cons:
-The texture was different, if not distracting when trying to eat
-I kept slathering it in sauce and parmesan cheese trying to mask the texture which then seemed to affect the taste. So is it really healthier if you are using that much extra sauce and cheese?
-I ended up throwing the other bags out after they expired because I didn't even finish the one bag of angle hair, so I wasted the money spent purchasing. I kept them in my pantry for a long time trying to work up the courage to attempt them again for a meal, but couldn't bring myself to do it.
The grass is always greener on the other side, but I will stick with my whole grain, spaghetti squash, or zucchini spaghetti. It may take a little more prep and time to cook, but I want to enjoy my meal over all.",3

AVQLXZ04FK0UV,"NO Calorie alternative to starchy foods: These are the ""noodles"" that have no calories, made from a root plant.  The price on Amazon is very good.  Otherwise, one must usually get these from a local health food store.

I personally don't care for the ""spaggetti"" type format of this product.  It in no way resembles regular pasta made from wheat -- which doesn't mean you can't use it as a substitute -- just my personal preference.

What I do like are the ""noodles"" that are more like egg noodles or rice -- especially the ""rice"" shape.  You definitely want to cook these with something that has good flavor of its own, because these noodles have no flavor -- at least nothing very palatable -- but they will absorb whatever you put them in.  So soups, stir fry -- careful with stir fry because they will jump around in the pan -- and sometimes out of the pan.

Just be sure to rinse well before use.  Turn your nose away when you open the package as it smells horrible.  They are packed in water by necessity.",4
A1QOF5LV7ICSK9,"Thank you Science: If you consider all of the disgusting zero calorie food options, this one is king among many.

What I don't like: At first, it's going to smell like something that came from the ocean. Run hot water, rinse it, and the smell is gone immediately. If this is a big deal for you then I'm sure the entire world is a huge struggle designed against you. The noodles are also transparent to blue looking, which is not going to make for an appetizing-looking meal in red sauce.  In summary, brace for temporarily smell and looks.  I don't have an issue with the texture, maybe because I actually took the time to both rinse and pat them dry, and heated them before and after adding sauce.

What I like: It's zero calorie pasta. Again, it's zero. Effin. Calorie. Pasta. These words do not belong together. Thank you, Science and Asians. Also, at about $2.33 a bowl that's also cheaper and faster to prep than going out and picking up fast food. For the lazy, this is also a win. I serve this with thick meat sauce and melted whole cheese like the world is ending and I'm not even breaking 100 calories a bowl, and it tastes damn good.

A1LYEKEFISH0M7,"Great if you are looking for a substitute for pasta/rice: I am a big pasta fan so trying to cut back on carbs for health reasons wasn't easy. These are a great substitute!!! It tastes just like rice noodles or very mild overall. Its not a spaghetti substitute, but good for soups, sides, mixes, or something where you place sauce or seasoning with it. Fast to make and do not be thrown off by the liquid they are in. Just drain, rinse, cook, eat.",5
A1EI6AALM0Y593,Try something else: They smell really bad and they have nothing to offer except decent texture. I expected them to be more like tofu noodles and at least provide some protein. If all you are looking for is something to replace pasta in your diet there are probably cheaper and more healthy options.,2

A2LH3TY7O8RADX,"They were AMAZING. No funny taste: I was a little bit worried about purchasing these because of some of the negative reviews about smell upon opening the bag.  The smell was a little bit weird, so I figured that it was probably just the packing liquid.  Then, it made sense to me why you have to rinse and then boil... you're getting rid of the packing liquid residue!  I was about to boil after rinsing, then decided not to.  I had just cooked 4 chicken thighs in a pan and there was still chicken grease in the bottom of that pan.  I added a bit of water to it and put it on the stove on high.  I threw in the noodles and cooked them until there was no liquid left.  They were AMAZING.  No funny taste... just like chicken-flavored noodles!  Excellent.  Will purchase again.",5
A35G9RZGHZIMHD,"Happy to get on the Miracle Noodle bandwagon: I love Miracle Noodles; i bought them because i am on a gluten free diet.
My favorites are the Angel Hair, the black Angel Hair, and the rice. Just rinse them as directed; they do smell ""fishy."" I cook them in broth or with a pinch of Celtic sea salt.
The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not a fan of the Fettuccini. I won't gross anyone out by saying what they remind me of. I just don't find them appetizing.

Once you rinse it really well, the smell goes away but hold your nose when you open the bag... whew.

Now that I've tried both, I would rather just use zucchini noodles or sweet potato noodles. Cooking time is comparable, they're cheaper, and they have a nice taste, albeit they have a few calories.
These taste odd (and they definitely do not replace rice or pasta in the texture department either).  They a little too slimy to compare to the real stuff, especially the rice.  They're so wet that when you add them to your curry/sauce/soup, it thins it all A LOT.  And since they've been sitting in water while in storage, they don't really absorb any flavor from what you add them too, so you can really taste the Shirataki part of them.",2

A2HZ1O76F32VWA,"It's rice for when your on a silly diet.: Just wanted to give a shout out to the Amazon review team, they work hard and sort through these things with quickness.

Anyway, this rice is pretty awesome, it comes in a bag and is watery, which is kind of weird.
But... It's got a good story about a family based business, and when you cook it up- it tastes pretty awesome considering it has like no negative impact on your body.

So when your doing diets like Dukan, these are great to break the monotony of your regular everyday foods.
You can throw some stir fry together, etc...

So definitely give it a try.",4

AJ1DH9O3YQK5V,"Say ""yes"" to shirataki noodles, ""no"" to the Miracle Noodle brand.: I've been using shirataki noodles for years and absolutely love them, but had never used this particular brand.  I decided to try a variety pack since I had never used any shapes other than angel hair and was interested in being able to make a wider variety of dishes.  First I tried the penne shape but I just could not get past the fishy smell and odor.  Now remember, I have used shirataki noodles for years and know how to prepare them and cook them and what they taste like.  These were absolutely horrible and inedible.  Instead of taking on the taste of the other ingredients - as most shirataki noodles do - all of the other ingredients just ended up tasting like old fish.  At first I thought maybe I just had an ""off"" bag, so I tried again.  Still horrible.  Then I thought that maybe it was the more robust shape that gave it a stronger flavor, so I started making my way down the scale to fettucini, then angel hair, and finally rice.  Nope...they were all horrible.  I ruined many a meal trying in vain to make these things edible (wasting an otherwise AMAZING shrimp alfredo...that one really hurt).  Finally I switched back to my ""regular"" brand which is House Foods (the kind without tofu).  They tasted great!  After House Foods brand I recommend almost any regular old brand you can get from an Asian food retailer.",1
AVO9Z7OOHDSQZ,"Similar to Vermicelli Noodles: If you follow the directions the fishy smell goes away completely. These are good for Asian Stir-fry more than Spaghetti. Once cooked, it feels similar to clear rice noodles. I love rice but prefer these over Miracle Rice. Miracle rice was disappointing as it is nothing like real rice . It's exactly the same as these noodles except they are cut into little round balls. Feels like your eating tiny little boba with your meal.",4
AM45D0WU5C4EW,"An interesting substitution for pasta and worth giving a try...: I love pasta. All kinds of pasta.... but after slowly gaining pound after pound each month, I decided to start watching the caloric intake. Pasta has tons of calories and these Miracle Noodles are definitely worth a try if you're looking for a substitute. No, they aren't exactly like the white flour pasta you're used but they have lots of potential.

First - they do smell fishy right out of the bag but if you rinse them as suggested before boiling them, it helps a lot! Secondly - I boil the noodles in vegetable broth which definitely adds flavor and very few calories. Lastly, I do saute them for a few minutes to dry them out a bit and while sauteing them, I add some seasoning. (Smoked Paprika is my favorite) Add some sauce and protein - it's actually pretty tasty. I found that flavoring the noodles really helps and seasoning barely adds any calories, if any.

So if you're looking for a pasta fix and don't mind the extra steps of making these Miracle Noodles, they're definitely worth a try.",4
A95ZJV34DJJUC,"So glad I took a chance and tried these. Great for low carb dieters wanting a bigger food variety.: Wow!! Was so surprised at how much I liked these. I got the rice version. It is very similar to rice, just a bit more cube shaped and moist/wet textured, some say rubbery, but I don't agree, they were soft and tender to eat(I did boil mine an extra minute). To cook: I rinsed it in cold water for 3Osec using a mesh strainer, then dumped into boiling water for 3 min, then dried out a little in a medium heat fry pan for about 3 min (though this step could be skipped possibly). I added butter and salt, and so good! It is very similar to rice! And such a nice change from protein on a low carb diet! 1 pkg to me is about 2 med sized servings. So in this quantity it's about 14 servings.",5

AO23QFLKHCZD2,"I never knew I liked the taste of pasta so much until I got this pasta with zero flavor: These noodles do not have a horrible smell or flavor like many complain about, at least I didn't really think so. The problem with these is they are almost completely void of taste once they've been rinsed and blanched.
Sure, you can cook them in the sauce you're using to give them a little flavor, but they are already very soft before you cook with them and I was afraid that much more would turn them into saucy mush.
All-in-all, these aren't the worst if you need to cut the calories, but don't expect to just change to this and not notice the taste difference.",3

Rice is great, angel hair is good, and fettucine is fair. The sampler pack was nice for us to determine what we liked most and least, so now we'll be reordering mostly Miracle Noodle rice.

A2L2SRQPLHEU22,"A Diet Miracle: I can understand how some people can't stomach this. When I first tried the strange yam noodle, I must admit, I had a mixed reaction--a combination of desire to love it and gag reflex.
I bought a couple test packs at the supermarket before making this relatively large order. And I definitely recommend doing this--just try everything twice! (I found them at Ralph's tofu section).
But, I think it comes down the way you cook them. DO THIS: Wash thoroughly. Throw in a non-stick pan (the kind that can cook eggs without oil) on high heat, and just let the water evaporate until you no longer see tini water bubbles boiling. Then, add your favorite pasta seasonings (hint: salt is a necessity). Some people say they like it best with creamy sauces--I find that nauseating. Not that I don't like creamy stuff, just these noodles are slimy enough on their own WHICH IS WHY it's so important to bone dry them in the pan before adding anything!
What's great is that I never even add oil. These guys don't burn--they're so full of water, the worst thing that could happen is they shrivel up. (Take them off the stove before this happens).",5
A3FVUJ6HFZSP0D,Great for diabetics: My husband is a type one diabetic therefore we limit carbs in our diet. They are great for losing weight as well.,5

A2IOA3FDOESLSQ,"I absolutely love these noodles: I absolutely love these noodles! For me, they are an excellent alternative to regular pasta noodles. It's hard not to love something that is so filling but has no calories. I barely notice the fishy smell a lot of other reviewers comment on. I just rinse them really well, heat them up on a frying pan for a minute or two, and then combine them in a bowl with spaghetti sauce. I stay full for hours!",5

A1DGNY01D7I0SX,"There are better alternatives....: Great food for the health conscience, but not worth the trouble. Texture in combination w/ lack of taste, and effort to prepare makes its a poor choice. Tripe, gristle, and organ meats don't bother me, but the texture on these noodles are challenging; similar to chewing plastic. Save yourself the trouble and go with high protein soba noodles or spaghetti squash or zucchini noodles.",2
A3C6VSY9XHFF0G,"Diet Helper: Love these with Braggs Aminos - I cook them with pork stir fry and with mushrooms.  You can burn out on them, but a great diet addition for 0 calories.",5
A14A4YYKPLYY26,"Meh! Disappointing..............Tastes NOTHING Like Real Rice!!!: When I decided to buy this&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Rice&nbsp;I did so, after having bought the&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Angel Hair Pasta&nbsp;and ABSOLUTELY LOVING it. Because I am on a&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet, which prohibits the consumption of wheat & any product made with wheat (pasta, bread, crackers, etc.) and I LOVE pasta & noodles, which are my favorite food after sushi, steak & shellfish, I was so glad to find the Miracle Noodle angel hair and fettucine pasta.

However, even though&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;is primarily a wheat-free diet, because its also supposed to be low-carb & grain-free, other non-wheat grains & starchy carbs like rice, potatoes and corn are discouraged (or at least advised to only consume in very limited amounts as rarely as possible)

Unfortunately I LOVE basmati rice -- especially when having it with the ""Morey's Seafood"" brand of ""Seasoned Grill Wild-Caught Alaskan Salmon"" which I get from the frozen food section at Costco (and prior to that, at Sam's Club) and ever since I started the&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet, I was missing having rice so much that I mostly stopped eating the Morey's Seafood Seasoned Grill Salmon, because it just wasn't the same without the fluffy & buttery basmati rice to enjoy it with.

Then I happened to see a listing for this Miracle Noodle Rice while ordering the&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Angel Hair Pasta&nbsp;and I knew I just HAD to try it.

Now before going any further, I just wanted to clarify that when I ordered this&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Rice&nbsp;I had NO illusions whatsoever that this would taste like basmati rice, in any way! Even before I ordered this, I knew it would be difficult if not impossible to replicate the taste & texture of basmati rice into a no-carb calorie free version. So despite the name of the brand, I was NOT expecting a miracle. However, while I knew that it would probably not taste like basmati rice -- I was hoping that it would at least taste like SOME kind of rice.

Unfortunately, I was wrong! Not only does it not LOOK like rice but it also does NOT taste like ANY kind of rice either!

This so-called ""rice"" is a bunch of tiny white little balls, that kind of look like caviar (though I've never had caviar, this looks like a white version of it!) or tapioca. In fact, when I made this for a close friend, one of the first things she said, when she saw it was that it looked and tasted like ""sabudana"" (which is what tapioca is called in many of the languages in India).

As for the taste,&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Rice&nbsp;does NOT taste even remotely like rice! Not only that but this ""rice"" doesn't even taste much different than any of the other varieties of Miracle Noodle pastas -- and as a matter of fact, it tastes more like an orzo pasta than rice, and I don't know on what planet this could in any way be considered ""rice""!

Even though I followed all the directions, and experimented with these in many different kinds of recipes, NOTHING I tried made it taste even REMOTELY like rice -- and it would have been better if they had just labeled this as an orzo pasta or something instead. At least then, that would be more accurate and honest. Becasue calling this item ""rice"" is VERY misleading and a HUGE disappointment!

Which is why, although I LOVE the&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Pasta, Angel Hair&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Pasta, Fetuccine, I will probably never be buying this so-called ""rice"" again!",2

Instructions says rinse 30 secs but I rinsed for several minutes. Just left in colander under running water while waiting for water to boil. Cooked in different types of sauces and the noodles to me seem tasteless.  You just taste the sauce and whatever else in in the dish, and they ARE filling.  They're almost slimy, but I'm on my third pack and almost don't notice the slightly odd texture (and I can't eat slimy foods but am able to eat this because I REALLY WANT TO and am WILLING myself to take it). I'm going to try smaller noodles now to see if there's a difference.",4

A3UEE22RNGQ2L8,"ZERO CALORIES, ZERO CARBS and EXACTLY like spaghetti. Miracle noodles, indeed. Changed my life!: This product has seriously changed my LIFE. I fight every day to keep my weight at its current level, and I simply must avoid carbs. The conflict is that my favorite food, since I was a child is spaghetti with meat sauce. Until I learned about this nearly unbelievable product, I  had to eat spaghetti sauce on bean sprouts (ugh!) or green beans (yuck) or spaghetti squash (wahhhh!) and people say they can pretend they are eating spaghetti but those substitutes are nothing like real noodles. AND THEN I FOUND MIRACLE NOODLES AND MIRACULOUS THEY ARE, INDEED! iMAGINE HOW this could exist: noodles that are EXACTLY like normal noodles, except they have ZERO CALORIES AND ZERO CARBS. It's almost like dreaming, to try to grasp that this product could even exist. I was once warned AGAINST this product by someone who said it tastes awful. It turns out that she did NOT follow the instructions on how to prepare them. When they come out of the bag, they smell like fish! You will worry and think there is no hope. But just go forward following the directions exactly. A lot of rinsing, 2 minutes of boiling, then a little while of cooking them in a dry pan. Is ANY kind of spaghetti so fast to prepare? And then you couldn't tell them from real spaghetti in a million years.  I will be very disappointed in you if you say there is anything imperfect about these, because if you say that, then I know you didn't follow the instructions carefully. I love them so much, I gave them as Christmas gifts. No one could believe it! ALL YOU CAN EAT spaghetti with no calories or carbs!!! Now I have subscribed to have them delivered monthly. I have to say you are simply out of your mind if you don't try these. You can eat ALL THE SPAGHETTI YOU WANT NOW. How did anyone create these? I don't know. But they are a MIRACLE and really changed my life.

Miracle Noodle Zero Carb, Gluten Free Shirataki Pasta, Fettuccini, 7-Ounce (Pack of 6)",5
A4UYIZYX621XO,Save your money.: Yuck! The texture is like rubber.  Fishy smell.  Threw out the entire shipment.  Almost made me regurgitate.  No exaturation here.,1
A2L54PTZXDD4NU,"I really love these, I really do!: These noodles are quite fantastic, even my kids won't stop eating them. I must say I would not substitute for traditional pasta and use with tomato or cream sauces, that would taste a bit off.
These noodles are comparable to glass noodles and go quite well with asian dishes. I use them in miso soups with tofu and assorted vegetables, in a stir fry with chicken and snow peas, even pad thai with some peanuts and sprouts sprinkled on top.
The noodles are packed in a liquid, that does have a peculiar smell, my advice, open the package, place noodles into a colander and rinse several times with water, then use in your favorite asian dish.
If you are trying to limit your carbohydrate intake, give these noodles a try.",5
AK5M1OBRGDL10,Good Noodle: Love them.,5
AGNJM28OGD4HD,"Don't bother, they're not worth it.: These are slimy, tasteless and expensive.  Most of the weight of the package is the liquid the noodles come in, which you drain off.  After tasting the fettuccini, I threw all the rest away.",1
AL5SCA7GAUH46,"if it sounds too good to be true it probably is...: I was so excited when I stumbled upon these noodles. I could hardly wait for them to come in. I finally cooked some up yesterday and was HORRIBLY disappointed. These things should not be called noodles. I wish that they tasted like cardboard because that would be a better taste then what comes in the bag.
-The ""noodles"" are over priced
-Gummy and have a disgusting taste. I took one bite and threw it away

Please don't buy them ....just don't you will regret it. I get a bit naseas whenever I think about them

AEMU4O9IBHYXV,"Not pasta but will work!: I wasn't prepared for the fact they came in a liquid. Weird. I was warned about the faint fish smell. Here's how I prepared them:
Put 2-3 qt saucepan of salted water on to boil.
Dumped contents into small colander and rinsed well. The slight fishy smell does not stay. It rinsed off.
When water is rolling boil dump noodles.
Cook three min exactly. Trust me.
I also added garlic salt to water.
Drain and put in glass bowl add whatever sauce you want. I used marinara. Coat noodles well. I put them in fridge and went to get in my 2 miles. So 1 hour later I was back. Don't judge me....
I had put a pan of the rest of marinara and 2 chicken breast on to simmer and it was bubbling nicely. I microwaved the noodles a min at a time till warm enough. Then poured hot chicken and sauce on top. Added some parm and we enjoyed every bit.

What you need to know besides the above:
The noodles have an obvious Asian texture. A bit like calamari without the taste or smell. Because of this I cut the long fettuccine noodles smaller. Smaller it not as bad texture wise.
They are like tofu. No flavor but they absorb the flavor of sauces beautifully. That's why I put them in the fridge.
Another thing. A 7 oz pkg is enough for 2. We cooked 2 packages and had twice as much as we needed.
Most importantly. We had been craving pasta. While different, we were very happy with it!
Trying Mac and cheese next. Boiling noodles in broth not water and using butter and cheese with a little broth for sauce.",5
AT6QJVZ5ENHRE,"Great: I really like this product for a number of reasons.  Size is perfect.  The flavor is really good when mixed with other foods.

The initial smell is off-putting, but goes away once drained and prepared.  You do need to chew thoroughly, or you'll be seeing them again. I'm really okay with ""regular"" pasta, but I did want to see what the hype was about. I'd likely buy again.",4
A3G174QTOQXI7O,"Love!!!: I've wanted to tell these for a long time. They are stinky smelling but after reading other reviews I learned how to prepare. Rinse, boil 2 min, rinse again, boil another 2 min, rinse and add to what you are cooking. EXCELLENT!!!",5

I just rinse it off, and add it to soups. etc.  It takes on the flavor of whatever you put it in.  I make a soup in bulk with ground turkey or chopped chicken breast, lots of veggies, soy sauce and broth and pack it for my lunch each day.  Healthy bulk with no calories.  One thing -- don't freeze it.  Add it fresh.  I froze my soup with MiraclNoodles in it once, and the noodles became like strings of plastic wrap in my soup.  Yuk. Maybe the Miracle Rice wouldn't do that, but I wouldn't take the chance.",5

A37CIMKXK0Q89Y,"Happy successful experimental noms ;)~: Had 2 servings of this with tomato & basil sauce, & nutritional yeast (which btw sounds yucky but has a nice cheesy taste) tonight, and actually like it better than the real thang (angel hair pasta).  No carbs, no calories, no gluten--just follow the instructions.  It absorbs the taste of whatever sauce you use with it;  so it will be good for white wine & clam sauce, mushroom piccata sauce, primavera, am going to see about maybe concocting a ""golden"" (nutrish-yeast for cheese) alfredo-tasting sauce too.  It's play-pasta!

I'm aiming for an alkalizing, feel-good healthy but tasty very low carb diet, mostly plant-based with salmon and crab legs occasionally.

I added my stir fry sauce. Not bad. They do have that slightly different thing that lets you know they are not your regular noodles they you have been eating since childhood, but it's worth it.

1. These are not like wheat noodles, so don't expect them to be. They are more like chinese cellophane noodles in texture--for people who are only familiar with wheat noodles, this is apparently too weird.
2. You'll want to follow the directions on the bag--drain, rinse, blanche, dry in the skillet, and add your sauce. I wouldn't say it smells fishy so much as sort of chemical-y, but if you follow the directions, the smell is completely gone.
3. These are better for some recipes than for others. Great in cream sauces (for those of us on a low carb, high fat diet), great in sauces with soy and garlic, not so great for eating plain or in a basic lemon sauce.

A2VD9KWGBO456R,"Wonderful product.  Plus simple tricks for the best noodles.: I first heard of Yam Noodles thru a diabetic food site and have used them ever since.  Then many miles to drive to an Asian market.  These are made of Asian yam.  Do not confuse them with those made of tofu available in supers,  a completely different food!

But,  as some reviewers complained,  there is an odor.  Here's the thing:  they are usually packed w. seaweed/kelp powder as a natural preserversative.  But they absorb any flavor in which they are cooked.  I wash the noodles thoroughly in a colander (the seaweed odor disappears), rinse often and well,  then cover them in fresh water in a container,  and put into the fridge.  Also give them 1 or 2 snips as it seems to be one very very long noodle.  Which is hard to manage when eating.

When taking them out to use,  you'll see the original odor is gone.  Their virtue is they take on any flavors/odors,  so they will soon taste like whatever sauce you use.  Usually I do a stir fry,  Asian style.  with some protein and vegetables and a brothlike sauce of some kind, eg. soy sauce, fish sauce, chopped garlic and shallots, and whatever flavors I choose.  First brown the meat, if using,  Then add your choice of vegetables, then add the sauce and the noodles.  Let the flavors merge on a low heat and serve.  There is absolutely no left over ""fishy"" smell.

Similarly in a broth,  used well rinsed noodles stored in fresh water.  Make a miso soup,  chicken soup, or whatever you choose.

On texture,  some complained of this.  But being used to yam noodles due to sukiyaki (which uses these yam noodles) I like the texture.  They do get softer than when tasted right out of their bag. The cooking time is minimal,  just let them absorb the flavors and they're ready to serve.  Leftovers are great.

You can google all the health virtues of these yam noodles,  which are also known as alimentary noodles,  as they clean out the intestines as they move through.  (One of the health virtues). Said to be a naturally high fiber food.

I especially like this version called Angel Hair,  the thinner noodles really work in a dish and are wonderfully flavored, by you, the cook. Japanese, Thai,  Italian, French,  the choices of flavors are yours.

The price is right as well.  Matches the rare market where they can be purchased.  They also keep well refrigerated in the packets for a long time,  but I'd recommend the thorough washing a day to a week before, but even washing before using in recipe that day will get rid of what seems like a 'fishy' smell,  but is really kelp.

Gluten free.  Zero calories.  Fills you up.  Tastes good.  And are good for you.  What's not to like?",5
A34KSLDN0058LF,"Great pasta, zero calories and filling: I gave the product a rating of 4 mainly because I of the three varieties I really liked the angel hair followed by the fetucini. The thord type, the rice-like pasta I did not care for. It was difficult to chew, and there got swallowed whole, which then gave some digestive problems. the other two varieties were fantastic. I read some of the other reviews before buying the variety pack. some indicated the 'bad smell'. True it does smell 'earthy', but if one follows the directions by rinsing the product under cold water for 15 or so seconds, most of the earthy smell disappears. when used in pasta dishes, there is absolutely no 'off' odor nor taste. Soooo, if I had oredered only the angel hair and fetucini, the  rating would have been a 5.

The way I used the pasta is to place half the rinsed contents in a soup bowl, add a cup of stir fry vegetables (asparagus-vegetable mix is my favorite), cover with a small plate,  then heat it in the microwave on high power for two and a half minutes. Often I add sliced organic chicken-mozzarella sausage. I season it with a little ground ginger, fresh lemon juice or with a few drops of low sodium soy sauce.",4
AVWU6GEX8IG8,"I made few changes and it came out delish!: I opened the package and put it under running water for about 10 minutes and let it drained to take out the fishy smell.
I had some chicken stock boiling and put the noodles for about 3 minutes after that I drained it and stir fryed it for 2 minutes.
I used it with a chicken spegueti sauce and it was delish!",5
A3W1KAK0S9OXE5,"Meh...The fettuccini are too gelatinous for my palate . We'll see if the angel hair or the rice do better.: So far, I have only tried the fettuccini. I wanted to like this product but it fell short of my expectations , specially after all the good reviews..
1- The smell: It does smell quite strong, kinda fishy,  right out of the package. I followed the instructions : rince throughly ( I even soaked them in cold water for a couple of minutes ), drained, boiled for 2 minutes , drained , and finally "" dried  "" them on the stove in a dry pan. The smell wasn't as strong after all that prep. but still noticeable if you get close to this product.
2- The texture : Those fettuccini are gelatinous. It's a strange texture that could take some time getting used to . Not a fan so far.
I did add them to a plenty saucy dish ( loads of mushrooms that produced more than enough cooking liquid ), chicken sausages , diced fresh tomatoes , and a little splash of sesame/ginger sauce. Kept the pan covered for a bit , hoping they would soak up all that good sauce. They didn't . The sauce won't get inside those gelatinous fettuccini.
3- You can find much better no gluten pasta on the market.
4- Probably ok if you are craving "" pasta /carbs "" in a low carbs diet since they have none or close to none calories. Personally,  I think i would better skip those gelatinous "" pasta "" altogether , as they bring nothing to a dish, expect that gelatinous texture.
I got the six packs , fettuccini , angel hair and rice. Not impressed with the fettuccini, will give these products another try , probably fish or shrimps ( mostly because they do have a faint fishy smell even after the whole rinsing, boiling, drying the directions tell us to do ), with angel hair.
I am hoping the angel hair and the rice will be a bit more palatable  and won't feel as gelatinous / slimy.",3

A1GXSHNKR4Z9CE,"Not bad, but not for me: I had been anxiously awaiting this arrival and was suddenly confused as I waited.

As per other reviews, I knew to expect an odor when I opened the package and rinsed it off as instructed. The smell is quite unpleasant but it does go away.
As far as flavor goes, they were not for me. Not bad, but not for me. I tend to be a self-proclaimed texture freak and these just did not sit well with me.

Yes, when you open the package, there IS a smell. Rinse thoroughly and that will get rid of most of it, but not all of it. However, I cooked it up with aromatics - onions, garlic, ginger - as well as some Braggs Liquid Aminos (instead of soy sauce), rice vinegar and a bit of Sri Racha (hot chili sauce). All these wonderful flavors masked any remaining smell from the noodles. The texture was perfect for an Asian noodle dish - I stir fried the aromatics and some veggies, added the noodles and some cooked turkey during the last minute or so to heat and absorb the flavors, and enjoyed. Very good and totally took care of my carb cravings.

I am not on a super-low calorie or carb diet - I eat plenty of veggies and some fruits every day. However, I am trying to limit my intake of starches. These noodles are going to help with that! I am not planning to eat these every day, just when I've got a serious need for comfort food.

A14A4YYKPLYY26,"I Can Have Noodles Again! Now, If Only There Could Be a Similar Zero-Carb or Low-Carb Equivalent for Bagels & Crusty Baguettes!: Earlier this year, I started a wheat-free and low-carb, mostly grain-free&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet, and among the many the things I've been missing, one of the things that I've been craving the most is noodles/pasta, since its my favorite food after sushi, steak & shellfish

Which is why I was SO glad to find&nbsp;Miracle Noodles!

Miracle Noodles are really a MIRACLE for those of us on low-carb & grain-free diets who love pasta.

It is so wonderful to be able to have noodles again in at least some form -- even if it doesn't taste *exactly* like the conventional wheat-based versions. Especially since with this pasta, I never have to worry about the carb content or even the number of calories and yet its still DELICIOUS!!

In response to other reviewers on this page who have complained that these noodles have a fishy smell.......they are only right, in that when you first open the noodle package, there IS a bit of a smell. However, as soon as I've emptied the noodles into a sieve or colander and rinsed it in water (I usually use warm-ish water) for a few minutes, any & all of the ""fishy"" smell immediately disappears.

Also to all those people who have complained about the ""rubbery"" texture of these noodles........if you buy these noodles, and go into the experience expecting to get an EXACT REPLICA of the conventional wheat-based and carb-filled starchy noodles/pasta, then you are going to be SORELY disappointed!

Because these noodles are NOT made with wheat or any other high-carb grain, they are NOT going to have the same starchy texture as conventional pasta. But that does NOT mean that they cannot be just as YUMMY in their own right!

Miracle Noodles are made of a healthy natural water soluble fiber (that has NO fat, sugar, or starch) called Glucomannan, and konnyaku flour, which is made from the Konjac plant which has been used in Asia for thousands of years, and is wheat-free, gluten-free, kosher, and has ZERO net carbs and ZERO calories! However, Miracle Noodles are unique and UNLIKE the conventional (and usually wheat-based) versions of pasta, and as such, they cannot be made and consumed in the same way as regular pasta, and expected to taste the exact same.

So, if you make these noodles expecting it to be just like regular spaghetti, where you just toss it in boiling water to cook it, and then drain out the water and mix it with tomato sauce and eat it, then not only will these noodles be a disappointment, but also you are missing out on the best potential of these noodles!

However, if these are cooked according to the package directions (rinse thoroughly in clean water, boil in salted water for a few minutes, and fry it in a skillet long enough to remove any remaining water & moisture) and then used in appropriate recipes (although I've only used these noodles in soups and Asian stir-fry so far, I've heard that the&nbsp;fettucine noodles&nbsp;are really good in recipes of Alfredo sauce made with REAL butter, cream and parmesan cheese!)

As someone who is currently on the&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet and unable to enjoy my 2nd favorite food (after sushi, steak and shellfish which all tie for the first place of my most favorite food!) of pasta & noodles, I think that&nbsp;Miracle Noodles&nbsp;are a wonderful substitute!

Although I admit & agree that even when prepared properly,&nbsp;Miracle Noodles&nbsp;still do not taste *exactly* like regular pasta, given that it has ZERO carbs and ZERO calories, in my opinion its close enough and it is a GREAT alternative for those of us who LOVE pasta/noodles but for whatever reason (being gluten-free, wheat-free [or even grain-free!] or on low-carb diets) are unable to eat regular pasta, to be able to enjoy noodles again!

I just wish there were an equivalent alternative for bagels and baguettes because then, instead of just staying on the&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet only long enough to meet specific goals (like weight-loss) like I'm going to be doing, I'd be a lot more willing stay on this diet permanently the way its developer, Dr. William Davis recommends making it a complete lifestyle change!

Now if only Miracle Noodle could just come out with as great an alternative for chewy bagels and crusty baguettes, I'd be ALL SET!!",4

Wrong.  Wrong wrong wrong.  No noodle should ever be as disgusting as this.  It is a sin.  The smell upon opening the package is akin to sniffing a stagnant swamp.  That should have been enough to keep me from trying them, but I ventured on and gave them a chance.  I made Pad Thai.  I followed the instructions for the noodle package.  Rinse, boil, dry, and then prepare as recipes suggest.  My meal looked delicious.  ""Hello noodles, oh how I've missed you!"", I thought to myself.  I took a bite.  The flavor of my meal was great.  And then, I tried to chew.  NOPE.  The texture was like chewing on rubber bands.  Each time I tried to bite down, the noodles sprung back together.  What was this sorcery?  Why wouldn't it just stay chewed?!  Noodles shouldn't put up so much of a fight.

I couldn't finish my meal.  I was left feeling hungry and disappointed.  I felt betrayed.  I wouldn't suggest trying these unless you like the look of intestinal parasites, the smell of swamp, and the feeling that you're chomping on a never ending supply of rubber bands..",1

A2QN4Z9GUUISQH,"Effective, but spotty quality control: As advertised, these noodles have absolutely no flavor, and also no calories. To cook them, I use a nonstick pan with no fat or spray or anything, rinse drain the noodles and just dump them in plain into the pan. I push them around a little with a bamboo spatula until they squeak (yes, they really do squeak like sneakers on a waxed gym floor when they're done--wait for the squeak, about 10 minutes on medium heat for me). Once they're cooked, they can be added to anything without falling apart. They'll last a day or two in soup as leftovers before disintegrating, but they will eventually dissolve into whatever you put them in. It's their way.

Obviously, they're best with Asian-inspired dishes (they're *wonderful* in pad thai), but I've gotten brave a few times and used them with red tomato spaghetti sauce. Let's just say that if the sauce is strong enough, they're far, far tastier (although not nearly as nutritious) than spaghetti squash or other common ""diet"" substitutes.

Most commonly, I use these as a supplement to my ""fast"" day dinner as part of the 5/2 diet I'm on. They can bulk up an existing portion so I feel full. One package is about one realistic portion per person.",4

I quickly rinsed the noodles and added them to some boiling water.  The package says boil for one minute - I boiled for five minutes.  I rinsed them again and I could still smell that fishy smell - but just barely.  I patted them dry in a paper towel (like the package instructs) and....Ta-da!!!  No more fishy smell!!  No smell at all and no flavor either.  I added the noodles to some homemade chicken noodle soup and they were good.  The texture was fine.  A little chewy I guess but nothing I couldn't handle - and that's saying a lot coming from me!

3. If you've got the time, try to 'dry cook' them by themselves in the microwave or a skillet for a couple of minutes before topping them with sauce.
4. If you don't have the time, add the rinsed and well-squeezed noodles to whatever you're cooking them make sure it simmer for a couple of minutes to allow the noodles to absorb the taste.
5. Remember: THEY ARE NOT REGULAR PASTA AND WILL NOT LOOK OR TASTE EXACTLY LIKE REGULAR PASTA. Sheesh.",5

A3GAMJOBLXAPS1,"Great Pasta Replacement, Problem is with the Orders Received: We really like the noodles, especially the Fettuccini style. We have tried them as a pasta replacement and soups and stir-fries and would recommend them to anyone. Yes, you do have to rinse them but with a good colander that is not an issue.

Here comes our only complaint. I tried to find a way to send a message without posting on the product but was not way found.
We have ordered these several times and with the last two orders we have not received what was ordered. I have been ordering the 6pk of fettuccini and one time I received Angel Hair. This time I received the assortment pack. With the last order the package had two labels. One on the end marked 6-Pk and one on the top marked Assortment. I did not want to leave a bad review on the product because I have no complaints with that. Only on receiving the product ordered. This will need to be corrected or I will not continue to re-order.",5

Honestly, I really wanted to like it but it simply is just putrid. Try imagining eating roe or fish eggs with no flavor (the rice) or worms, yes, worms (the linguini).

This swill is slimy and in no way even comes close to pasta. (I did cook it right so don't flame me for that) I get a kick that they promote it as being thousands of years old and from Japan. Ya, so? Does that make it edible? Hardly.

Do yourself a favor and save your money on this crap and have smaller portions of the real stuff to loose weight or just die. Ya, your better off dying then eating this s***.

AATRYGM6QA1CI,"My Miracle Noodles!: These noodle are fantastic! My sister introduced them to me when she prepared one of her dishes and I've been a fan ever since. I ordered four boxes (24 packets total) of my own within days of trying her dish. I love how they taste and I'm thrilled that they are low calorie or calorie free! I've read a number of reviews that mentioned the fish smell when a packet is opened and I will admit that this is true. However, the smell, in my opinion, is not overwhelming and is easily washed away with cold water using a strainer. I've enclosed two dishes* I made with the angel hair and fettuccini packets. :^) Someone mentioned that these noodles don't work so well with pasta dishes but the dish that my sister made for me was a spaghetti and meatball meal using the angel hair noodles. It is because of her variation to this pasta dish that I eat these noodles for dinner every day now.  I'm aware that miracle noodles aren't for everyone as tastes differ but, I couldn't be more satisfied with the new addition to my menu. *Dish One: Saut&eacute;ed Eggplant with Mushroom and Onions Over Angel Hair Shirataki Noodles. Dish Two: Saut&eacute;ed Fish with Shirataki (Fettuccini) Noodles. Note: To minimize the calorie and fat intake, I use Pam butter flavored cooking spray instead of butter or oil for saut&eacute; dishes.",5

I followed the instructions on someone elses review on cooking them and they turned out great! Like others have said- don't smell them. Cut them open and rinse them for a minute- then immediately dry fry them until all the water is out. After that you can mix in your sauce or whatever else with them. They are a little rubbery texture- but I usually make sure there is a chunk of vegetable or chicken with each bite and I can't even feel the texture of the noodle. Very good for a low/no calorie option!,5

No need to freak out about smell when you open it, its all because of what the noodles are made of which goes away easily when rinsed (which is what you're supposed to do). The zero calorie part is great when you ran out of calories for the day, but it definitely tastes that way lol. I just couldn't put much flavor in there so it's not for me but may be for other people! I'd say try it out because if it hits the spot for you, it's amazing for when you're hungry but don't have many calories left in your day.",4

Easy to prep, just slice open the stinky bag, rinse well, cook in pan to dry out the noodles over medium-high heat per the instructions; you can boil as well (boil with ginger to hide odor) if the extra step is necessary but I just rinse and cook. I add whatever topping/sauce I desire. My current favorite is Pepper, Tomatoes, and Goat Cheese.

I contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund (and let me keep my noodles, to boot).  They said they couldn't replace my order because they could not guarantee the next batch would be any fresher.  That was kind of lame, but honest.  Anyway, I ate the noodles and liked them.  So I ordered another batch.  These were a MONTH beyond the BBD.  I'm not going to complain to Amazon because I was forewarned--sort of.

Anyway, I really like these noodles.  In my experience, the swamp smell goes away with about 30 seconds of rinsing.  I heat them in a pan for three to five minutes to dry them out.  They don't taste as good as pasta, but they also don't feel heavy in my stomach like pasta.  And with zero calories, I think calling them ""miracle"" noodles is not too much of a stretch!",4

I was leery the first time I ordered them, but I liked them.  The initial ""fishy"" odor when opening the package my turn some people off, but it dissipates quickly when rinsing them in cold water for a few seconds.  They do not have any fishy taste whatsoever.  For people who have ""texture"" issues with their food these might be a problem as they are a tad bit rubbery, but I figure it is a small sacrifice to be able to use something that does not have a negative impact on my sugar levels.  I do use them as a spaghetti replacement and they work great.  After you cook them and drain them, I do find it is imperative to dry them on paper towels.  If not, they retain a great deal of liquid.  I enjoy incorporating them into my meals.  I made Korean chicken the other night, cooked my Miracle Noodles, added some cooked broccoli and it was delicious.  I keep these in my pantry at all times.

A1Y88IU2EJK7SV,Not good at all!: I don't even know where to start!  I was wanting these to work out so bad!  They have a fishy smell and are slimy even after drying them on a paper towel!,1
A2FC7PR30V0XOQ,"Love the concept, but blech!: I love the ingenious concept of 0-10 calorie food.  I imagined myself cooking this stuff in lieu of pasta and saving hundreds of calories.  But, unfortunately it doesn't absorb flavor well and has a slimy, rubbery, light taste.  Kinda like eating a pony bead.  There's no satisfaction after consuming.  3 of the bags are still in my fridge and no one is touching them.",2
A1J1STRTNOB4U4,"I can't get past the rubbery texture: As a child, I chewed on a rubber band because I was curious. These linguini noodles were EXACTLY like that. Then I tried the angel-hair pasta style. Not really better, but I could at least swallow them because I didn't chew them. On the plus side, they are an appetite killer! I have yet to try the rice style, but I will try them in a soup so that most likely I won't try to chew them. I cooked the angel hair style differently (after finding some YouTube suggestions), but it wasn't enough of an improvement to make me buy these again. I guess some people love these, but I have vowed not to eat things I dislike just because they're a ""lesser evil"". It was worth a try; now I know.",2
A377FD0C514X2L,"Excellent flavor absorber and good enough: These aren't super delicious, but they are incredibly helpful for maintaining a lower carb, healthy diet.  The texture takes a bit of getting used to, but once you do, they are such an awesome replacement for pasta.  They are filling when added with a bunch of veggies, a bit of meat and a yummy sauce and they won't give you any insulin spikes.  They also help to save you from consuming a whole bunch of empty calories (from pasta or rice).  Also, my 3 and 4 year old boys always want to have a little bit of my pasta, even when they have the real thing.",4

A31WQB2NR3C84P,Try it: I am happy with the product. It does not have flavor but you can make soups and stir frys adding your own flavor. Zero calories and you get to eat a big plate! I will probably not purchase again just based on the cost. You need to cut them first or you will have a very long noodle.,4
A360PARLPTOWLP,"I was hopeful, but they didn't keep me as a regular: They seemed like a great concept, but it just doesn't quite meet expectations. Yes I got the fishy smell and overcame it by some thorough rinsing. Here's where they went wrong in my opinion.

1. Portion size... ridiculously small from a pasta perspective. I made the mistake of assuming that one package would feed two people. They come packed in water, which probably lead to that assumption if you're looking at weight (or in this case volume).

2. Taste... they were okay and did soak up whatever flavorings I added fairly well

3. Consistency... I could see why some people were put off. I ended up doing stir-fry which helped with that. Of course the added oil partially negated the promise of zero calories

Overall, they were too much of a hassle for the benefit. They are way overpriced compared to pasta. I won't be buying more",3
A1GUNG6BK1OJK0,"Awesome Substitute: Great way to cut out a bunch of calories or carbs. A lot of people are complaining about the smell and the texture. The smell is not present after they're cooked, and I feel as if the texture is on par with normal pasta that has been overcooked and has become mushy. I made low carb shrimp alfredo and these noodles worked perfectly. Already ordered some more.",5
A3UTJGJ00Q85OL,"Good way to cut calories: First things first, you can't treat these like normal noodles/rice. They will not ""fry"" like normal rice/noodles do. However it's a great way to cut a significant amount of calories from a meal. There is a ""fish"" odor when you first open the bag, but that goes away very quickly. I always ""dry roast"" the noodles, never boil. Basically you just want to get the water that was in the bag with them to go away before you add your sauce.

Speaking of sauce, that's the secret to cooking/eating these. The noodles/rice have no real flavor of their own, so they sort of soak up whatever sauce you're putting them in. I've used teriyaki, ""orange chicken"", Alfredo, spaghetti, and even just soy sauce with really good success. Usually I pair these with 1lb seasoned chicken or drained ground beef and its a lot of food that fills me up. Dishes that I tried without any ""sauce"", like fried rice and buttered noodles didn't work very well.

The only problem I have with these is that they are VERY expensive when you compare them to standard counterparts, so I limit myself to one a day.",5

A1F6P34QOFYSRS,"VERY RUBBERY - NOT WORTH THE HIGH COST- TAKE A LONG TIME TO COOK AND RINSE.: Nice idea if you can afford the high cost for tiny bags.  Takes a LONG TIME TO COOK them up, so they r not crunchy. I have to boil them for at least 40 minutes to soften. Kind of a pain, and very expensive online, cheaper to order at local grocery store. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE DESPERATE FOR LOW CARB HEALTHY NOODLES, I SWITCHED TO THE TOFU NOODLES, THEY ARE SIMILAR, WITH NO POTATO STARCH, AND THEY COOK QUICKER, ARE SOFTER.",1

All you have to do is rinse them in a colander for 30 seconds to a minute before boiling/cooking them and the odor completely disappears. They are delicious.
There is no way you can enjoy any other noodle for free calories, fat or carbs. I HIGHLY recommend them. My favorite is the fettuccine but have also tried the rice.",5
A23WEPQ972STTH,"First time we've tried these...: We've only cooked one of the six packs, and I'm hopeful that our mediocre experience is due to not cooking them right, and not the quality of the item.

I use it in Alfredo and they were so good.. definitely recommend it for keto diet,5
A2Q8S3P6RK7QT3,"Great for ""healthy eaters"" :): They smell a little funny coming out of the bag, but what do you expect from a noodle made out of some kind of yam root? If you are used to ""health foods"" you will love these. If you are expecting spaghetti, you probably won't be very impressed. I think they are great, but any noodle is better than no noodles if you are trying to keep the calories down.",4

However, since the noodles are bigger, the smell of the water in the packaging is harder to get rid of.

I was skeptical since everyone said they smell terrible until they're prepared. I just followed instructions and cooked them with butter and garlic/pepper mix. Delicious:) The texture isn't amazing but the smell is gone and they serve their purpose. They are technically healthy- just water and a different type of wheat. Easy and quick to prepare. The package says they absorb whatever sauce they are put in. So, some people seem to recommend putting them into sauce and letting it marinade overnight. I didn't and I they were fine. By themselves they are tasteless and a little rubbery.
PROS: Easy, quick, filling, healthy, low-carb.
CONS: Good God. The smell when you open the bag is horrendous (what IS that??!). But once they are rinsed and prepared they are fine.

I'd give them a 5th star but the smell is a real turn off.",4
A1Y1X7RHKCGVSS,"Good, but do not freeze leftovers!: These work fairly well if rinsed as directed on the package. However, I had leftovers and froze them for lunch the next week. Freezing this is not recommended, as they get tough and overly chewy when reheated. Over all, a good product.",4

Eaten the rice Miracle noodles in both a sweet and savory application.  They have no taste...  Texture reminds me

They smell like fish upon opening the water pouch they come in and I followed directions and boiled them and tried to put organic spaghetti sauce on them but they stick together and are extremely hard to stomach because of the alien like texture and flavor.  I was very disappointed and I'm returning the remaining packs.,1

If your looking for it to taste like pasta you will be disappointed, I found that it was more like the Chow Fun (rice noodle) you would get at Chinese takeout. It did have a very slight fishy smell (that some other reviewers mentioned), when you open the bag, but once you do the preliminary rinse & boil, it disappears.

For best results, rinse again after boiling to get the mildest flavor.

A1K2DMG3ZUXUDS,"Couldn't live without 'em!: First of all, I'm not going to lie. If you're looking for something that tastes exactly like pasta, you're going to be disappointed... but if you take it for the zero-calorie alternative that it is, it's a godsend.

I'm on a strict low-calorie diet, which leaves NO room for carbs... So discovering these was a total life-saver.

Don't let all the comments about the smell scare ya too much... I was nervous about that myself, but the truth is, that ""fishy"" smell is no worse than, well... fish. If you've ever cooked seafood, it's really no big deal, and like everyone says, it rinses right off.

The trick to getting the right texture is just to fry the hell out of it, until it's almost dry. At least that's how I like it. I never bothered boiling it. It's the easiest thing in the world to cook, because it doesn't stick to the pan.

I like to fry it with a little soy sauce for a good 5 minutes or so, and then throw it in a pot of chicken broth with some vegetables and meat/eggs/tofu. Instant ramen! I've also stir-fried it with sweet 'n' sour sauce and broccoli, and eaten it like spaghetti with tomato sauce. Either way, it was pretty damn tasty. The flavor is all in what you put in it. You can't go wrong with a good sauce. Not that you have to drench 'em or anything. Honestly, they aren't bad. I could probably eat it by itself with a little salt, but that might be a waste.

That said, the bags are pretty small... Just enough for one meal. But at $2 a bag, I won't complain.

I think I'll be needing more of these pretty soon.",5

(Yes it smelled fishy, but I knew it would, so it wasn't a surprise, and after preparing, it didn't taste fishy at all.) After a rinse, I put them in boiling water for about 5 min. Then back to a cold rinse. A few minutes later, back to boiling water and then on over to a frying pan on Med. heat to dry them out. (cooking instructions on packaging say to do this). After this, I added 5oz of precooked shrimp, and 1/4 C light alfredo sauce... It was sooo yummy! You would've thought you were eating a real high calorie pasta dish. What a great find!",5

So far, I have just tried the Angel Hair Pasta version, and will try the Rice and Fettuccine soon.

API194PYN87HW,"Not spaghetti.: No matter how I prepared this I just couldn't eat it.  I was trying to find something to replace  pasta,  I am a very good cook, but this isn't it.

Since I'm on ketogenic diet and I was craving for some noodles, I thought this product would be great as a substitute. It came in the mail today and I was hyped! I followed the instruction carefully. I got rid of the odor, but the texture of the noodle is the biggest problem... Despite its benefit, it tasted like rubber and made me almost throw up. I'm sorry but not going to eat it again.",3

A16XRHU6XM2BKH,"very very disappointed.: this item is no way near rice and should not be described as a substitute for rice. if you are a rice lover such as myself, do not buy this product. very very disappointed.",1
A2S0V8W2F9C8XS,"Just try them already!: I'm writing this review in the hopes of helping other people who are on the fence about trying these.  After reading other people's reviews, I had no idea what to expect.  Apparently, I was going to either fall in love with this noodle substitute or be completely revolted by it.  Eventually I took the plunge and bought some.

Here's the lowdown:

-  No, the noodles don't smell great when you open the package.  As others have said, they have a fishy smell.  No, it is not some overwhelming stench that will knock you off your feet as some people seem to insinuate.  You will have to run them under cold water for a minute or two.  I guess some people can't get over this smell and decide not to even try them, but that doesn't make much sense.  Lots of foods don't have a good smell or appearance before prepared, yet that doesn't stop us from eating them once cooked (eggs, raw meat, etc.).  After rinsing them, boil them for a few minutes, drain them, and you are ready to go.
-  No, these don't taste exactly like regular pasta noodles.  The texture is a little different.  So if you are expecting something completely identical and indistinguishable from your favorite noodle variety, you will be disappointed in that regard.
- As others have said, the best way to prepare the noodles is with an Asian-type sauce.  Sure, you can use alfredo sauce, spaghetti sauce, etc. if you want.  No one is going to stop you.  But you'll probably be comparing it to regular pasta the whole time you are eating it and feel disappointed.
-  How I prepare them:  I rinse and cook the noodles as stated above.  Then I add some frozen vegetables, which are usually a microwavable steamers variety because I'm lazy.  A ""stir fry"" mix like bell peppers, broccoli, onions, etc.  I also add a little meat.  Lately I've used stir fry beef/steak that I cut up into small pieces and cook on the stove with a little olive oil.  Usually I add some spices with this such as turmeric, cumin, garlic powder, paprika, chile powder, etc.  For the sauce I use a 12 oz. jar of Indian sauce purchased from my regular grocery store, like tikka masala, vindaloo, etc.  Usually this is between $3 to $5.  A few brands that come to mind are Patak's, Seeds of Change, etc.  These have less fat and calories than most pasta sauces and seem to go well with these ""noodles.""  I usually use three packages of the noodles when I prepare a batch and then have three meals out of it.  They do seem to taste even better the next day because the noodles have absorbed more of the flavor.
-  No, you can't just live solely off of these for the next month in an effort to drop 20 pounds or whatever.  Look at the package.  It is devoid of nutrients.  Even with adding the other stuff as I've suggested, you are probably not going to get all the vitamins and minerals your body needs.  But you can substitute these for a very low calorie meal a few times a week that leaves you full, satisfied, and without having to suffer as many hunger pains while dieting.  In the last month I've lost 7 pounds.  I don't attribute all of this to the noodles.  They're not a ""miracle"" in that sense.  I've been watching my calories and doing light exercise, and these noodles have helped me with low calorie meals that don't leave me starving ten minutes later.",5
A25SY25HRS2GYW,"OK, but not worth the price: I didn't like the rice, but the noodles are better. However, very costly and took long time to get. If you are a noodle freak, then its a good healthier substitute. If it were cheaper and took less time to get here I might order more noodles.",3
A2SV3LKPQAMTWT,"and they do a good job of that: I'll buy these when I need to sate my craving for pho or pasta, and they do a good job of that, but the texture does leave something to be desired and they're still a bit too pricey for me to eat on the regular.",4
A2KJ9CKHQW19U6,"Absolutely love them!!: Absolutely delicious meals could be made out of these pasta and rice substitutes!! I made low-carb chicken fried rice and it tasted delicious! Yea, it has an awkward smell when you open it, but you rinse it in cold water and drain it and the smell is gone! I dry the rice or pasta in a pot to make sure it's not rubbery or sticky then it really soaks up the sauce you add to it afterwards! Great option without the guilty feeling and bloating!",5
A3W4Q5401XZQHI,"Not my favorite: Of the 4 Miracle noodles I've tried this one is not my favorite, I'm not sure if it's the garlic herb flavoring but the taste of this one is more fishy smelling even after rinsing and boiling. I don't taste any garlic or herbs unless i add them myself so I don't see the benefit of buying them this way. I would buy the fettuccini without the garlic and herb however. These weren't bad-just not my favorite.",3
A18XJVFXNGRKR7,"OVERPRICED and clearly misrepresented in quantity.: The package says 8 ounces.  It doesn't say that you get 8 ounces of ACTUAL product.  SIX ounces is just WATER!!!  What a crock of bull, because it also says that there are THREE servings in a package, at 2.3 ounces each.  Also a crock of bull, because the instructions tell you to DRAIN the water.  How on earth did I pay $14 for what amounts to about ten ounces of rice????  Good lord.

On the up side, if there is one, it is easy to prepare, absorbs flavors well, and is okay, taste-wise.  But in order to have a reasonable meal, I would have had to open ALL SIX PACKAGES I bought to get enough for TWO people.  Sorry, this is a huge cost rip off, and Amazon lets them lie about it because you are NOT getting eight ounces of product per package.  You are getting SIX ounces of water (at least) and barely two ounces of product.

I'd do without any kind of rice product rather than buy this overpriced garbage again.",2
A1J23OB3GNMSU4,Tastes great!: Tastes great and no calories!,5
A1GKE5FVJ86Y6V,Great alternative.: Miracle noodle are surprisingly good. Will order again and pass on that they have given me a great alternative to eating pasta.,4

A113W76W6BWAZQ,"These need to be recalled!: I love Miracle Noodles......NORMALLY! I just received my latest Subscribe and Save order, and there is definitely something wrong with this latest batch. They ARE NOT, repeat NOT the normal Miracle Noodles. They are seriously defective. Rubber bands would be a good description. Obviously, there was some kind of quality control issue at the factory. I'm getting ready to call Amazon and Miracle Noodle to let them know that they need to issue a recall, ASAP. I hate this for people who are trying these for the first time! There's no way I'd ever order them again, if I didn't know how good they are normally! I generally order the variety pack, but I liked them so much that this time I ordered a case of each. Last night, I was making Fettuccini Alfredo and opened a pack of the fettuccini and could see, right away, that there was something wrong with them. So, I opened a second pack, and they were the same. Then, I opened a pack of Angel Hair, and it was the same way. I opened the box of rice, and the rice is fine, and obviously, from a different batch. I checked the batch numbers, and the two bad ones have an expiration date of December 9, 2018. The date on the rice is November 18, 2018. If any of you had the unfortunate experience that I did last night, I urge you not to give up on them! I follow a low carb/Keto lifestyle, and these fit in wonderfully as a substitute for pasta and rice.",1

No flavor at all so you can control that with whatever you add. The texture takes a little getting used to. A little slimy,5
A2FYEJJ44RTBGV,"Best diet food ever: Take time to prepare properly (rinse, blanch,dry fry) and you wil find that they taste like whatever else you're eating. I also suggest snipping them into small lengths as you drop them in the boiling water-it makes them easier to consume, because, out of the bag when you pick up one, you pick them all up. Try this: as you prepare the noodles, bring a cup of chicken broth to a boil, after dry frying drop the noodles in there, let 'em simmer while you saut&eacute; 100g of diced chicken, onion, celery, pepper, whatever.  Toss it all together, grate some ginger on it, and you've got a giant bowl of stir fry weighing in at less than 200 calories.  Amazing!",5

I like the angel hair the best as I use that in some of my asian food recipes that would call for clear rice vermicelli.  Doesn't hurt the taste of Thai to have that slight fishy odor.  They're all a little clear in appearance and don't have the same ""give"" as real rice or noodles but do the trick to fill the plate and my belly.  Expensive, but I think I'll try again.",3

Then enjoy them with any topping. They have zero taste, so whatever you add to it is what  The true flavor will be. It's not like tofu, where people say it has no taste or it taste like whatever you put on it. Tofu has a taste of its own. These noodles have no taste.

They're filling and are awesome if you're on a diet. I boiled a bag of the noodles with 2 beef bullion cubes and it's like eating Ra-men. That being said, I've found my local Walmart carries Nasoya pasta zero plus noodles that taste much better and are less expensive. If I didn't have this option these would get a 4, maybe 5 star review, but having those as comparison affects my opinion.",3

I'm a pasta addict. I admit it and I'm only slightly ashamed. In an effort to abate that addiction, I tried these and the one word that I can say about them without being too negative is ""GROSS!"" And the smell? ""OMG!""
Seriously, they are gross and they are nothing like pasta. And they smell like day old fish.
The reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because they are indeed without calories and, honestly, I haven't yet tried them in some of the suggested recipes. As a plate of noodles with a sauce, they are very unsatisfying. I am assuming that they might be more edible in more complicated recipe.
Final word....""YUK!"" If you're a pasta lover, as I am, you gotta keep looking for that appropriate substitute, cause this ain't it.",2
A2KKIZV36JABKP,"Pretty Pretty Pretty cool.: Awesome. Knowing that whatever protein or sauce that I put on it are the calories that I'm eating is worth it. We are going to start using these for camping and backpacking because they cook so quickly.

They have no flavor of their own except for the nasty fish smell of the water they are packed in.  There is no nutritional value and even with a quality organic sauce they are hard to get down.  They are no means like real pasta and should not even be compared to pasta.  I have it 3 stars only because all this information is already posted in other reviews so I got what I expected.

A1XQ8N9212UQTG,"Save yourself time, calories, $$ & hassle: best Shirataki noodles ever: If you are anything like me, you'll want to experiment with your newly purchased Spiralizer to produce low carb, guilt free pasta in a var&iacute;ety of presentations. My In Spralize It! Cook book had dozens of recipes I wanted to experiment with. I viewed lots of videos featuring calm, happy Spiralizers cranking away with root veggies: j&iacute;cama, daikon radish. I'd been f&oacute;oled. Until spiralizing time, I hadn't even met a root.vegetable. I chose, as my 1st foray into  fetucine based veggies ,noodles dishes: the Inspiralize It! Pad Thai recipe. Have you actually met a j&iacute;cama? Have U become FB friends w/ a daikon radish? Two words: root vegetables. They were c&aacute;ntankerous with me, insolent. Neither daikon nor jicama were easy to peel, let alone spiralize. These healthful veggies are oddly shaped, do not lend themselves, as their cousin, the easy to spralize zucchini to zippy quick prep. Oh, no, jicama & daikon proved to be the pit bulls of vegetables, not attractive, filled with nutrients, yet so weirdly assymetrical that they were difficult  to reposition between the  Spiralizer end blades. For my debut jicama based Pad Thai, I managed to work the Spiralizer to render forth about a cup and a half of jicama noodles. I get it now that I should never have begun any Spiralizer recipes before taking stock of my expertise in this arena. Now, please welcome, TA-dah!! My introduction & use of Miracle noodles! I combined, & henceforth, always combine veggie noodles w/Miracle Noodles. I won't bore you with prep details. You will want to rinse, microwave, several times. I added 2 bags of Miracle Fetucinne 2 plump up my scant production of 1 cup of jicama fettuccine. Result: my guests raved about textures, taste test successful! I'm the rockingest hostess I'm my hood, Los Feliz, Ca, where celebrity chefs virtually live next door. Note: the Amazon pricing for Miracle noodles is competetive with barrio supermarkets here. I'm a believer.",5

Then my metabolism decided it was done helping me out, so I had to cut way back and it made me so sad :( until I found about these noodles, pasta was my guilty binge food. I'd deprive myself for weeks then go ape over an entire box of fettuccine. Of course I'd feel terrible and scold myself only to repeat this pathetic cycle over and over.

Now Miracle Noodle! It's not the same as regular noodles. It's just not so don't expect it. Rinse it, quickly dip it in boiling water, and serve them up!

These little lovelies are enough to keep me satisfied and ward off any binging episodes. I am set free! I can enjoy my mom's seriously amazing from-scratch spaghetti sauce without feeling like I have to PR on a run to make up for it.

ARX081ZXLOSLL,"Great but tiny and expensive for the size: Wonderful substitute for regular noodles, so long as you don't expect them to actually taste starchy (and feel starchy in your belly). I would say they are fairly similar to pho noodles, mainly because pho noodles are in a broth and don't seem starchy. Maybe that's why I don't care for pho noodles. They are full of carbs, but don't taste like it. If I'm going to have carbs, I'm going to have pad thai noodles or spaghetti bolognese. For zero calories, I really have no complaints about these whatsoever. They seem very light when you're eating them, but a few minutes after your meal, you realize you're surprisingly satisfied and remain that way for at least a couple of hours (at least I do.) These are very tiny packages though. I can easily eat 2 by myself for one meal (probably 3 even). I'm going to start purchasing them from Asian markets where you can get 14 or 16 oz for about the same price. I'm happy Miracle Noodle is marketing these to Westerners, but eventually they're going to want them cheaper and venture to the Asian markets.",5

A14A4YYKPLYY26,"I Can Have Noodles Again! Now, If Only There Could Be a Similar Zero-Carb or Low-Carb Equivalent for Bagels & Crusty Baguettes!: Earlier this year, I started a wheat-free and low-carb, mostly grain-free&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet, and among the many the things I've been missing, one of the things that I've been craving the most is noodles/pasta, since its my favorite food after sushi, steak & shellfish

Which is why I was SO glad to find Miracle Noodles -- and out of all the varieties I've tried so far (Angel Hair,Fetuccine,Rice, etc.) I have to say that&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Angel Hair&nbsp;is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!

It is so wonderful to be able to have noodles & pasta in at least some form again -- even if it doesn't taste *exactly* like the conventional wheat-based versions. Especially since with these noodles, I never have to worry about carb content or even calories!

Miracle Noodles are really a MIRACLE for those of us pasta & noodle lovers on low-carb & grain-free diets. Its so versatile, so far I've used it in soups, stir-frys, and salads, and its been DELICIOUS!!

In response to other reviewers on this page who have complained that these noodles have a fishy smell.......they are only right, in that when you first open the noodle package, there IS a bit of a smell. However, as soon as I've emptied the noodles into a sieve or colander and rinsed it in water (I usually use warm-ish water) for a few minutes, any & all of the ""fishy"" smell immediately disappears.

Also to all those people who have complained about the ""rubbery"" texture of these noodles........if you buy these noodles, and go into the experience expecting to get an EXACT REPLICA of the conventional wheat-based and carb-filled starchy noodles/pasta, then you are going to be SORELY disappointed. Because these noodles are NOT made with wheat or any other high-carb grain. Miracle Noodles are made of a healthy natural water soluble fiber (that has NO fat, sugar, or starch) called Glucomannan, and konnyaku flour, which is made from the Konjac plant which has been used in Asia for thousands of years, and is wheat-free, gluten-free, kosher, and has ZERO net carbs and ZERO calories!

As such, because Miracle Noodles are not made with wheat (or any grain) they are NOT going to have the same starchy texture as conventional pasta. Instead, in my opinion, the texture of these noodles are more like that of ramen noodles, and as long as they are made the right way, they taste DELICIOUS!

If you make these expecting it to be just like regular spaghetti, where you just toss it in boiling water to cook it, and then drain out the water and mix it with tomato sauce and eat it, then not only will these noodles be a disappointment, but also you are missing out on the best potential of these noodles!

Because&nbsp;Miracle Noodles&nbsp;are so unique and unlike any conventional and usually wheat-based version, they cannot be made and consumed in the same way as regular pasta, and expected to taste the exact same. However, if these are cooked according to the package directions (rinse thoroughly in clean water, boil in salted water for a few minutes, and fry it in a skillet long enough to remove any remaining water & moisture) and then used in appropriate recipes (in my opinion & experience, these kinds of noodles work best in soups, and Asian stir-fry dishes) they still taste pretty good.

What I usually do with these noodles is this. First I cut open the package and empty the noodles into a sieve or colander, and rinse them in water for a few minutes under the kitchen tap, lightly shaking the sieve/colander all the while to make sure that all of the noodles have been thoroughly rinsed, and are free of the ""fishy-smelling"" water it was packaged in. Once the noodles have been rinsed, I shake out all the remaining water from the sieve/colander, fill a small pot or saucepan with moderately salted water, and add the noodles and bring it all to a boil.

After it has boiled for about 2-3 minutes, I take the pot off the burner, pour the noodles back into a sieve/colander to drain the water, and then put a little oil (I usually use olive oil -- but only regular olive oil, and NOT the ""extra-virgin olive oil"" which is not designed for the high temperatures of cooking) in a skillet and saute the noodles to get rid of any remaining water/excess moisture.

Then in another (or the same) skillet, or a wok, I heat up some aromatic & flavorful oil (preferably those used in Asian cooking like sesame oil) and add some fresh minced garlic, ginger and diced onions (at this point, mostly white or yellow onions with a smaller amount of green onions) as well as a little organic, wheat-free soy sauce. After a minute or two, I pour the noodles into that pan and stir-fry it with the ginger/garlic/onion/soy sauce mixture for a few minutes before adding various vegetables (mushrooms, green onions, matchstick carrots, etc.) and meats and/or seafood (shrimp, chicken, pork, etc.).

Next, I add whatever Asian seasoning sauce I'm in the mood for at the time (whether a teriyaki sauce, or a Hoisin sauce, or if I'm making these noodles for people who like spicy food, then a ""Hot & Spicy Szechuan sauce"" or whatever) stir it in, and let it all simmer together for a few minutes. Then I add some salt (I usually use Himalayan pink salt) and pepper to taste and mix it in well before finally turning off the heat, and letting it sit in the pan for a few minutes for the sauce to thicken a bit before serving -- and even though its not exactly like regular noodles, it is still GREAT nevertheless!

As someone who is currently on the&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet and unable to enjoy my 2nd favorite food (after sushi, steak and shellfish which all tie for the first place of my most favorite food!) of pasta & noodles, I rhink that&nbsp;Miracle Noodles&nbsp;are a wonderful substitute!

Although I admit & agree that even when prepared properly,&nbsp;Miracle Noodles&nbsp;still do not taste *exactly* like regular pasta, given that it has ZERO carbs and ZERO calories, in my opinion its close enough and it is a GREAT alternative for those of us who LOVE pasta/noodles but for whatever reason (being gluten-free, wheat-free [or even grain-free!] or on low-carb diets) are unable to eat regular pasta, to be able to enjoy noodles again!

I just wish there were an equivalent alternative for bagels and baguettes because then, instead of just staying on the&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet only long enough to meet specific goals (like weight-loss) like I'm going to be doing, I'd be a lot more willing stay on this diet permanently the way its developer, Dr. William Davis recommends making it a complete lifestyle change!

Now if only Miracle Noodle could just come out with as great an alternative for chewy bagels and crusty baguettes, I'd be ALL SET!!",5

A1ATII36JCN5NT,"Ever had a plate of snot? What? Sounds too gross? Exactly my point...: I have never regretted going Low Carb so much until now.

Yeah when I heard that I could a get a carb free ""pasta"" through an online article, I thought ""Hey!! It's like a better invention than the wheel!""  If there is something I ADORE is pasta, the hardest thing for me is to go on without Pastas and Breads, so I came here and bought the 6 pack because i'm thinking of having pasta frequently! It's low carb, combine it with a light homemade tomato sauce and you've got a winning diet!

Gosh was I wrong. I did read the terrible reviews but I just thought ""Haha! These reviewers are expecting too much, obviously, this has no flour so it's not going to taste like regular pasta duhh!""

The first thing you notice when you open the package is the strong odor that I can only describe it as Sodium Bicarbonate and shrimp.

But that's okay because after it's cooked it goes away.

The flavor : Tastes like nothing really, just like unflavored gelatin.
The texture: Here is the killer....remember those sticky rubber hands you played with as a kid? This is EXACTLY what it's like, it's like chewing on rubber, it's quite disgusting, the texture alone will make you gag.

I had to throw away everything after 2 bites, I just couldn't get it down. If you liked this stuff, good lord you're a soldier! Hats off to you....

A2G05YXF2JKH3G,"FYI - same stuff as in Lipozene: It might sound strange, but these noodles are made of the same thing as in Lipozene.  I prefer to eat the noodle form, although they honestly have no taste so you have to work with them a bit.  The texture is not bad at all, and this brand seems the same as the House brand I have used.

When you go low carb, noodles are an issue.  Sometimes I eat Dreamfields and that's okay but they do have some carbs.  But these have no carbs.

The only thing I wish for these guys and other shirataki (konjac) noodle purveyors to US markets, is that they have a variety where the noodles are cut to size (2"").  Regular dry spaghetti can be broken into pieces (I do about four pieces per length), and you can easily cut fresh noodles before cooking.  Shirataki noodles tend to bounce off the knife, so I have struggled to cut them.

Warning: be careful giving these to children (although they should not be using them anyway).  Konjac products have been implicated in choking deaths, although mainly the candy form.  They are not too easy to chew, so I'd also not suggest them for someone with teeth or jaw issues.  Really they are just fine for most adults though, and you can chew them, but don't stuff your mouth full of them.",5

A283ZNA4Y8Y3PR,"I was COMPELLED to write a review...: Okay. I was extremely skeptical of these little water-filled baggies of ""fake noodles"". I had read horror stories about the fishy odor and rubbery texture. As a low-carb junkie, I REALLY missed the sauces and meals associated with pasta. Enter the Miracle Noodle.

Here's what I feel should be addressed:

- THE SMELL. Maybe my sinuses are flared up worse than I realize, or maybe I'm at a genetic disadvantage with a lowered sense of smell. But whatever the case, I did NOT find the smell oh-so-offensive as others have described. I actually braced myself as I cut the pouch open the first time -- ready for the worst -- but I didn't smell anything until I literally put my nose an inch above the open bag. And I'd describe the smell as more of a ""brine"" than a ""fish"" odor. C'mon guys, it's not bad.

- THE TEXTURE. I've found that the texture varies greatly on the preparation of the noodles. My first time eating them, I was rushed and starving... so I ate them straight out of the microwave tossed in pesto sauce. Not so great -- they were definitely rubbery this time. BUUUT, the SECOND time I prepared them, I made a creamy based sauce (melted 1 oz. cream cheese, 1 Tbs heavy cream, and 2 tsp. coconut oil, topped with some curry powder) and LET IT SIT for 2-3 minutes after preparing the dish. This way the sauce reeeally soaked into the noodles and gave them a softer and less-rubbery texture. Oh, and I just nuked them in the microwave this time, too. THIS time was good. Definitely a more ""noodle-like"" texture. I ate every last noodle!

Also, some tips I've read are to microwave the noodles twice PRIOR to preparing them. By this, I mean: Open bag, rinse in warm water, microwave 2 minutes, rinse again, microwave for another 2 minutes, rinse one last time. At this point they're ready to prepare as desired.

I'm pleased with my purchase, and I'd recommend these to people watching their glucose levels or anybody wanting a zero-carb option.",5
A10VQQA05YIIS0,Even my daughter liked them.: I bought this on a recommendation from a friend. I was trying to cut out carbohydrates for my diet. I very much enjoyed the flavor and texture of them. My teenage daughter even liked them. Quick and easy to heat as well. I will be getting more of them.,5
A3SVZVV8SSAOVP,"Great for what it is!: Lifesaver if you are watching calorie, carb, sugar or any type of dietary restriction. It is what it is. If you are expecting real pasta, then this obviously isn't for you. Honestly, I love the chewy texture and it absorbs any sauce very well.",5

AL3VIGHXWFHAG,"At first I was apprehensive because I was not sure if I would like it but I went ahead and bought the whole ...: I bought this because I'm trying to lose weight for my wedding. At first I was apprehensive because I was not sure if I would like it but I went ahead and bought the whole 6 pack anyway. Here's my feedback:

1 - Serving sizes. You can get two average servings in each pack.
2 - Taste and texture. The taste is almost non-existent, which is just fine since I accompany this with meats, veggies and sauces. The texture is soft and gummy unlike real rice, which feels more solid. I can see the texture being perfect for noodles, though.
3 - Smell. You have to rinse it very well under running water through a strainer for at least 30 seconds. Instead of simply blanching, I boil them in water for at least 3 minutes before draining and serving. There is no hint of the strange smell after wards.
4 - It does fill you up. I feel almost as full as I do after eating real rice.

If you're trying to lose weight and still want to enjoy a rice meal here and there, this is an excellent alternative. It may be expensive but if you're the only one eating this at home it shouldn't be too bad.",5

A3EF05D34I21L5,"Love this product!: Absolutely love these,  as far as the 'fishy' smell, i didn't find it as offensive as some other readers. I've tried other brands but I keep coming back to Miracle Noodle products.

Just a few tips, rinse in cold water for at least 2 min,  add to boiling water for at least 5 min.  This helps remove the smell.  And remember this isn't a 'real noodle' so don't expect the same consistency.  I've learned to cut them to a more manageable size, they are very sticky so pre cutting helps grab the right bite portion.

Excellent product! Very highly recommended!",5

A8B5OWVCRMJK,Five Stars: I really like these noodles,5
A1LGE1WKUV8RS8,"It's okay, but don't confuse this with angel hair pasta: If you're very serious about (as in, medically required reduction of) carbs/calories and/or gluten, the high price may be worth it as long as you're not expecting a realistic culinary replacement for angel hair pasta. This is not pasta. These are noodles and when finished as instructed, aren't long, straight strands - more like randomly twisted, kinky noodles and a lot of little pieces. So don't expect ""al dente"" results; they don't have the texture of rice or bean noddles nor wheat pasta and nothing sticks to them.

One 7oz small bag is just enough for two not-too hungry people, so if you're trying to feed a family or want leftovers you'll need more than one bag. Which means you're spending ~$1.35 per serving for four compared to ~$0.50 each for a quarter-pound of dry pasta.

I'd suggest them as a no-carb replacement for mung bean-based (""glass"") noodles in oriental soups but noting that they are difficult to eat with chopsticks because of their inherent slipperiness, I'd suggest you just go for it - raise the bowl, guide a few into your mouth and start slurping!

As to the smell - the angel hair (un-flavored) had only a slight, unusual odor that disappeared immediately while rinsing.

All in all, unless or until it's something medically required, these are okay but simply too expensive for us.",3

A1123L6S4LFM6C,"Like them just fine: These are pricey for what you get.  I suspect that an Asian market would have them cheaper, however I don't live near one so got these.  I am satisfied with them, I won't say they are super tasty and love them, however they fill their purpose for me. Adding fiber, no calories, having  a noodle texture and giving bulk to a meal when I need it (I seem to be starving since going on a keto diet)  And they don't raise my blood sugar, which is verging on T2 when I used to have low.

They do have an unusual smell when you open the pack, it frankly does not bother me at all.  I love kimchee, fish sauce and Thai shrimp paste.... I gave them a quick rinse under warm water and tossed them (the rice kind) in the stir fry when I was about done.  I was full and satisfied. Win, win!

It does have a fishy smell when you open it but if you follow the directions (rinse and heat) on the back of each pack, that goes away completely.

These noodles have a unique texture that is a bit hard to describe- they have a slight elasticity to them which plays a factor in the texture. They also absorb the flavor of what they are cooked in.

A1D2OLE59DIBL3,"I would recommend you season them with whatever spices you like (e: While I have not opened this shipment yet, I use 2 packs of these type of noodles a day.  The trick is not to follow the directions on the package.  Instead, I would recommend you season them with whatever spices you like (e.g., salt, pepper, curry powder, etc.) and then dry fry them in a wok for 5 to 10 minutes.  Further, if you want a shorter noodle you must cut them prior to frying as the finished product is not that easy to cut (e.g., a fork won't cut it -- at least not easily).  Finally, I would NOT recommend that you use them as a replacement for tomato or cheese based sauces.  They have the wrong texture to actually replace a pasta.  They are, however, excellent with curry and Asian dishes.

Addition:  This noodle has a fishy smell when you open it.  THERE is no fish contained in the noodle.  Just rinse thoroughly and the odor is washed away.",5

Some basics to know. Yes, they smell funny at first. Dump into colander and rinse. The odor is in the liquid not necessarily the noodles. The texture, doesn't bother me some people have texture issues. If you're ever had Rice noodles or Bean Thread Noodles you can compare the texture to that.

Cooking. You can toss them in a dry pan once rinsed and cook till mostly opaque or toss them in with what ever you've begun for the last 5 or so minutes of cooking and they're done.

A107CIOQHQ521I,"Very good product, great price: Amazon's got the least expensive price I've found on these noodles.  In case you were wondering, they're shelf stable and don't actually need any refrigeration (most non-Asian grocery stores refrigerate them because people have come to expect that -- there's no need to).  You must rinse and drain them well, but after that, they have much less of their odd taste.  Their texture is very unlike pasta, so if you haven't tried them, I'd recommend trying one bag of them before buying this multi-pack.

I was skeptical when I first ordered this product but have reordered several times now and I really enjoy it, especially the ""rice"" version. If you enjoy traditional rice noodles, I would suggest giving this product a try, as it is quite similar in texture to a slightly under cooked rice noodle. Absolutely make sure to thoroughly rinse the noodles in cold water before cooking (otherwise they will smell like rotten seafood). I also think it's important to note that these noodles absolutely don't taste like anything - so you will need to add them to something with plenty of seasoning (e.g., curry, etc.). I have substituted the ""rice"" version of this noodle several times for the pasta in macaroni and cheese (e.g., used the flavor packet) and it has been great.",5

Dont expect to just take it out of the bag, rinse and smother in some store bought spaghetti sauce, and have a great tasting meal.
What I do is rinse it, strain it, then cover in your favorite powdered seasoning, and herbs. Allow the seasoning and herbs to dry the noodles out. The noodles then absorb the flavoring of your choice of herbs and spices. Stir fry in coconut or extra virgin olive oil for an even bigger burst of flavor and add some meats and vegetables.

It did wash off after only a few seconds in a sieve under warm water. Then I threw the angel hair into my cast iron pan, prepped with heat, a little olive oil and salt\pepper. Since I'm not a gourmet chef, I threw in some soy sauce, chinese five spice, and some sliced london broil. It turned out pretty decent.

I would say that these are definitely more of a ramen-noodle texture than a spaghetti texture, so if you condition yourself to expect that you will be fine. The noodles absorbed the flavors, possibly a little too well, and held up throughout the cooking. Looking in the package you'd expect them to be too squishy like spaghetti that has been cooked too long. Not so with these 'noodles'. I liked them.

Four stars because you're not getting a whole lot for what you're paying, but the quality is good enough that it deserves better than average.

My packages came packed about as you'd expect. Some of the photos people posted showed a very small amount of product. I think they may have had a bad run or maybe a distributor that was selling knockoffs for a time. My bags were ok.

A17PELZKRAIPLZ,"No fishy taste if you cook it right: I had tried the miracle noodles years ago out of curiosity and did not like the fishy taste. But I now realize that it was all about the way you prepare it and it makes a world of difference! You first need to drain the liquid that it comes with and rinse with water a few times. Then put the drained noodles on a frying pan (no oil) and dry stir fry it for a few minutes until most of the moisture is gone. THEN you can eat it with sauce, in broth, whatever sauce you eat with. I have been on ketogenic diet and I missed eating ramen / soupy noodles and I use these noodles with the same broth and it hits the spot for me. No fishy taste whatsoever and the noodles do soak up the sauce/broth somewhat, though not as much as regular noodles. The good thing about this is that the shirataki noodles do not get soggy like the regular noodles do after being in the broth, which is nice! I highly recommend these noodles; I like the angle hair noodles as well. I have not yet tried the ""rice"" which I got as a package.",5
A290JPPHVH1QTX,"Miracle Noodle: I bought the variety pack and I was quite surprised at the taste. After draining and rinsing the noodles I mix with meat or vegtables with a good broth. It helps to add to add 1 or 2 TBS of cream soup to mixture. Add it at the last, but long enough  for noodle to absorb flavor. If you can get passed the look of the noodles then it serves its purpose. No Calories.",4

The mouth-feel is very good and they take on the flavor of whatever they are cooked with. I throw them in the oven with cream and butter and salt and pepper and crumbled bacon and make quick fettucini alfredo.

For diabetics, it's important to notice these are NOT made with potato flour (as are some other Shiratake noodles.) so Yay on that as they will not affect your blood sugar at all.",5

The noodles are not finger-licking good, but it does taste good enough for something that has no calories.

A2MZ5MCG121DVR,"A Delicious Miracle!: I'm sorry. It simply must be said. Miracle noodles are nothing short of miraculous, and those of us pasta lovers fighting the carb war should consider giving this particular noodle a try.

Miracle Noodles are actually Shirataki Pasta made from the soluble fiber of the Konnyako Imo root, allegedly used for thousands of years as part of a healthy diet in China and Japan. Because it's made from soluble fiber, your serving of Miracle Noodles has zero calories.

Your order will include six 7 ounce bags of Miracle Noodles.  Don't let the 7 ounce size put you off.  Americans are so used to our big portions but believe me - this is soluble fiber, people -  fiber!  It not only fills you up, but you really don't want to eat more than 3.5 ounces in once sitting.  If you do you'll find yourself sitting somewhere else for a very long time!

These noodles are so easy to use. They come ready to use packed in water. Simply drain the noodles and rinse them for 30 seconds. They claim to take on the flavor of any sauce you prepare, but the water the noodles comes in is slightly fishy so be prepared, but don't let it stop you. Continue to gently rinse until the majority of that scent is gone. Then treat it like any other pasta. I have used these for aglio olio, Thai based dishes, and good old marinara. I prefer the fettuccini noodles, which I'm reviewing, but there are others to choose from.

Is it exactly like pasta? No. But if you're looking to add fiber to your diet, consume fewer calories and enjoy a dish similar but not exactly like ones you already love, give these noodles a shot.

Warnings:
*** Those With Allergy/Intolerance To Gluten Should Be Cautious.  The front of the package says they are vegan and gluten free, but the back of the package notes that the noodles are manufactured in a facility that also processes soy products. This is probably key info for people with Celiac Disease as some soy products can have ingredients in them that aren't gluten free.

*** There are rumors that replacing other foods with these noodles can help reduce sugar levels and cholesterol, but I imagine replacing any not-so-healthy foods in your diet with high fiber, lower calorie foods can accomplish the same. If you're considering these noodles as part of a new health regimen I recommend talking about it with your doctor first because I am not a health care professional.",5

I was extremely excited to finally have something that wouldn't set my heart palps off. I took a bite and blech. It was like having a mouthful of nasty overcooked flavorless ramon noodles. A few more bites confirmed my hatred of these nasty things. Mind you, I'm not even a picky eater. I can tolerate most anything, but ended up throwing all of these away.
I suppose, if snipped and thrown in a soup one could tolerate them.

During stir fry process I added 5-8 mins extra as I dry fried them with a lil olive oil. Then added other ingredients/chopped veggies, sauce,etc. Once the veggies were complete, so we're the noodles.

They are not exactly the same as flour/egg noodles, so don't expect that. But I would say they're a 10/10 substitute for rice noodles. I used the ""rice"" in stir-fry and it was pretty good- not amazing, but pretty good. The rice was comparable to tapioca beads, and I think honestly would be really nice in a pudding dessert minus some of the carbs :)
I plan on using the noodles in some thick spaghetti sauce with ground beef soon, and making some kind of pho. They do smell weird but after you do the instructions on the package and let them sit in a broth/sauce for awhile they just assume the taste of that broth/sauce and there's no odor.",5
AY2BT9JTN8OOW,"Dry-Fry for AT LEAST 5-10 minutes!!!: This is my first review that wasn't requested by the seller. I JUST got these an hour ago and they are AMAZING. I ordered these last week and couldn't wait to try them, so I went to my local asian grocery since I knew they would carry them. They did not have Miracle Noodles so I purchased an off-brand that I don't recall. They were tofu based and came with a much longer ingredient list. I did dry-fry these and I have to say they were edible but I would not have purchased again. Comparing the two brands Miracle Noodle was an obvious winner. The ""fishy"" smell was much less obvious than the other bag I purchased and the dry-frying method gave these noodles a much better consistency. Now I did dry-fry for around 10 minutes until I heard the noodles squeak (I did not dry fry for this long with my first batch of shiratake noodles). I didn't see many reviews list a time recommendation for the dry fry- but thats what I did and I think it made a huge difference. I had to stop myself from eating the entire bag (but I guess its ok if I did). I combined the angel hair noodles with thinly sliced cabbage, a scrambled egg that I fried into a disk and then cut into strips when cooled and topped that with roasted Pork Belly and left over keto-friendly Pad Thai sauce (coconut aminos, roasted sesame oil, swerve, red boat fish sauce, coconut milk, sunbutter and pepper)",5

If you are hoping to use this just as you would any other pasta / rice, you are truly expecting a Miracle!  If your goal is to find a binding / filler food that will absorb the great flavors of the foods you are trying to prepare with no carbs, this product is for you!  This is great for spaghetti (as long as you cook and season it WITH the sauce), or a soups, fried rice, gumbos, etc.  Don't forget to prep the noodles first by rinsing them off, boiling them for under 3 minutes, and then dry roast them for about a minute (this info can be found on their website).

I have found that frying them after rinsing takes away a little bit of the chewiness of the noodles, but I have also simply rinsed them and they were still ok. I also like to cut them up before adding them to dishes or else they get tangled and it is difficult to just get a small bite. I love adding them to curry soups or other brothy mixtures because they just take on the flavor of your dish. For someone who is gluten and carb conscious it is nice to have these as an option.",5

everyone has been claiming it's ""just like real noodles"" and that I ""won't  be able to tell the difference""
Well, the difference is actually really clear; normal noodles don't taste like fish no matter how hard you try to get the fish taste out, normal noodles don't leave little particles in your teeth, noodles don't have a gushy crunch to them,and normal noodles don't have the texture of a fat worm in your mouth.

The noodles basically have no flavor so the possibilities are endless.  I prefer the angel hair noodle.  After thoroughly rinsing and draining in a colander, I saute with a pat of butter in a skillet for 5-6 minutes, then add chopped fresh tomatoes, jalapeo, & garlic.  Season with garlic salt - yes I love garlic, and pepper.  This is my go to meal and I eat the entire package.  Would give this product 5 stars if they offered a larger portion per package.  I do not find the smell offensive ... reminds me of fresh mushrooms, that earthy smell.  But as many others noted, it goes away after rinsing.",4
A187HXR1PUDC82,"Very Good: I'm relieved and pleased that this pasta is quite good.  I agree that it has a bad odor - smelled like stinky shrimp shells - when I first opened the package.  But I just followed the directions on the package - empty the pasta, rinse it for 20 seconds, boil it for 2 minutes, and then dry it in a paper towel.  And then I followed other reviewers' advice and cooked it with my sauce for a few minutes on low heat.

Although they were slightly rubbery, I think this pasta is a great substitute for the regular, high carbohydrate pasta most of us eat.  I will definitely eat more.

As far as the weird initial odor goes, we as Americans need to remember there are other stinky but healthy food items in the world, like durian fruit, that others consider a delicacy.

If you're serious about giving up carbs, try this stuff.",4

Taste: comparable to glass noodles, though I detected a little saltiness when bursting into the noodle.
Texture: aldente, smooth, almost silicone rubber-like. You cannot boil them longer to soften them. If you don't do the drying step (these require more steps to prepare than traditional rice/pastas), they will stay slippery, otherwise they will dry and stick comparably to pasta. If you like glass noodles, you can tolerate these.
Look: white - to - cloudy transparent

4-stars only because I don't think I can get used to them.

Tip: the rice is great mixed with refried beans, which I allow.

Service : A+. One of my rice came leaking at the seam. My exchange request was surprisingly easy and completely handled thru Amazon. No emailing the seller.",4

Basically the noodles will just taste like whatever broth they are in.
Some comments have mentioned the water they come in as smelling ""funky"", don't let it worry you....no big deal, they get rinsed anyway. It basically smells like a very, VERY diluted fish sauce.

Rinse them off and throw the drained noodles in a pan and fry them a bit to dry them out. Then use them like regular noodles and add sauce or whatever you want.

As far as the texture, you do have to get used to it. Its a SUBSTITUTE for grains, so manage your expectations. The texture is a bit like a mushroom, so if you have trouble with that I would say to skip this product. If you don't, really it only took me one or two bites to get used to it. For people who are dieting and want a filling alternative to add sauce to, these are great. Great for people on a paleo type of diet as well.",5
A3I7GLBHAHNFY,"It's.. okay I guess: I'm eating this (Shirataki Rice) right now for the first time. I am aware it has no taste and a weird texture, so I made it Asian style. I put it in a pot (don't smell it, it's weird), rinsed it in a colander and then I boiled it with some beef stock. Then I added some sliced Chinese salted sausages (lap cheong) and mushrooms, and mixed it with the 'rice' as if it's a porridge. The point here is to have stuff with strong flavors to take over the meal, don't go for subtlety here.

The texture is weird.. it is definitely not rice-like. It's reminds me of tiny jellies, smooth and pearl-like. If you are particular about texture in your food, then you may not like it.

I am almost finished eating, and with the beef stock soup and the salty sausages, it is quite a delicious meal. I will be trying other recipes with this. It is definitely NOT a rice substitute though. It's fine once in awhile for a diet or something, but definitely NOT a rice substitute.",4

Yes, they're a little chewy and they don't have the same consistency as pasta - but I can't eat pasta because of all the carbs.  As far as I'm concerned, with a little practice and some compromise in expectations, these are truly a 'miracle' for those of us who have to keep our carbs to a minimum.  They work especially well in Thai and other Asian cooking.  I've even baked 'macaroni & cheese' with these, and although it was nothing like the original I chopped up a chicken sausage into it and it was delicious, still offering up the taste (if not the texture) of homemade mac & cheese.",5

The ""rice"" variant even tasted well in a low carb jambalaya I made in the crockpot. What I can't handle however, is the PAINFUL, NASTY, RELENTLESS digestive ""issues"" that accompany this product! I thought maybe the first time with the pad thai was a fluke or due to some other ingredient, but the same exact thing happened again using it the second time around.

Also you have got to rinse the heck out of them to get that smell and stuff gone. Once you do that though they are ok. I found that if you saute them a little after cooking in a dry pan it will help with the texture and the consistency and they pair really well with a good strong sauce.

A1LNUBK8OQCGAE,"Take a little care to get the texture right, and it works well: I bought this product along with the angel hair noodles from the same company.  They are both soluble fiber based low calorie starch alternatives that work very well in recipes to give the experience of eating pasta or rice without the starch.  Both are excellent, but you may have to experiment a bit for best results.  I like a chewy noodle, so I had no problems at all with their noodle product.  The rice was another story.  My first experiment with it, I just rinsed the product off and threw it into soup to boil for a while.  That was a disaster.  It was like little pieces of rubber.  So the next time I boiled the product for 4 minutes and then threw it into a frying pan for 2 minutes to dry if off, and then put it into a recipe and it was perfect.  Just slightly larger and slightly more texture than white rice and very enjoyable.  Not much taste on its own, but I used flavored oils and garlic in the brief frying and it worked out very well.

This might take just a little experimentation to get the texture the way you like it, but it is a great rice alternative I think.",4

A2M9IS41H1HJAI,"Follow the directions, and these will be really really good.: Quick update on 11/21/14

Just started putting Old Bay Seasoning in the water that I boil these in. Seems to add some flavor to them but it also changes the color. Looks very close to the color of pasta!

---------------

It's kind of sad to see so many have given these 1 star. Being someone who believes strongly in 'Low Carbs' are healthy, I worked at learning how these should be cooked. Maybe many of the 1 star people didn't care that much?

Almost forgot to mention, the exp date on the ones I received today are Jul 2015.

Rinse them in a colander (cold water) for a minute or two, there should be no smell now. Boil them in a pot for 3 mins, then rinse again (pat dry with paper towels and try to squeeze out as much liquid as possible). Now put them in your already heated non stick skillet. I do this on a setting of 3 on the glass top stove.

At this point, because I've never read where someone has said how much time to do this for, I've been kind of guessing or listening for 'squeakiness'. I just now made these and decided to extend the time for this part. Not sure if it was the extended time or that simply these noodles are better than the ones I've gotten at walmart, but these were really really good. The texture was really just like spaghetti.

I top off these noodles with Bella vita low carb pasta sauce... wow, it's really awesome to be having spaghetti again!&nbsp;Bella Vita Low Carb Pasta Sauce Spicy Tomato",5

A3QPM8GRP15MUT,I really wanted to like these. I only tried the angel hair: I really wanted to like these. I only tried the angel hair. The initial smell is VERY strong. My husband smelled it across the room. The smell does subside when rinsed and boiled.  My issue was mainly with the texture. One that I cannot describe..also one that I could not get myself to enjoy. I threw out most of the noodles.  I'm hoping the rice is better.,2
A1ZZ014HSEFZHD,One Star: So gross.  Threw them away,1
A29EX9OJPYIJIX,"quite good alternative for pasta if used with sauce: It's true that these don't taste exactly like angel hair pasta; however, they really do pass for pasta when used with copious amounts of sauce/ seasoning.
They smell unpleasantly fishy when first opened, but you can remedy this by rinsing them thoroughly.  I put them in a sieve and rinse them under the faucet for about two minutes, flipping the noodles around to ensure they're well rinsed.  This almost entirely eliminates the fishy smell.  I then put them into boiling water for about 2 minutes.  With spaghetti sauce, baked turkey, and vegetables on them, they really are quite tasty, and they certainly satisfy my craving for pasta.
One pack of these is pretty much a serving.
Would highly recommend if you're looking for a low-carb alternative to pasta.",5
A2PIT3TTPWRTSL,"it tastes pretty good and it fills me up: Not exactly the same as pasta noodles and I wouldn't eat it plain, but it absorbs the flavor of anything you add to it. So if you add alfredo sauce or tomato sauce, it tastes pretty good and it fills me up.",5

I honestly didn't even notice the ""fishy"" smell until I read reviews. The next time I used it, I sniffed it right when I opened it, and it does indeed have a fishy or briny smell, but it wasn't strong enough for me to notice it initially. Once it's rinsed, this smell basically goes away. I use a mesh strainer which fits the whole bag at once to rinse. I put it in boiling water for about a minute (I wait until it's boiling again to start timing the minute). Then I strain it back through the mesh strainer. I have not dried it on paper towels as recommended. I just let it sit in the strainer to drain and then add it to whatever I'm making.

A2GWUZ1QMFHOH8,"Not just salad for dinner or lunch: With some members of the family unable to eat carbs, these noodles and rice let them not miss out on any meal.",5
A26A0S3EHBFD9R,"A product which might be a bit misunderstood...: I don't write reviews, seriously this is my first review and what compelled me was the polarizing nature of the product! I've made about 6-7 different meals with this product and just to address some of the issues:

The smell is definitely one of them.  The best way I've found to prepare these is to rinse, boil, rinse and dry in a non-stick pan on ~medium low heat. This I've found leaves the noodles with a more neutral smell.

The texture is something people comment on and I think this is the biggest misunderstanding or misrepresented part of the product. The closest equivalent imo are cellophane/mung bean/glass noodles commonly found in many types of asian cuisine. Both texture and utility seem similar. A problem is the product is somewhat advertised as a normal ""western"" noodle replacement, which I think is difficult as common western noodle dishes were not refined over time with this type of texture and flavor in mind. Also it's clearly not something many people are used to.

With the above said, I think these are still useful and versatile if one is trying to cut carb calories down. It's important to find compatible recipes which luckily there are tons of ranging from stir fry to soups to stuffing for wraps and even cold salads. I think people would have more luck using and liking these by trying cellophane/glass noodle recipes. Also the use of fragrant ingredients such as ginger or cilantro helps if one is especially sensitive to the smell.

Finally I didn't give it 5 stars mainly because of the price. I really hope due to volume there is a way to make these more affordable in the future. They are currently 6x+ more expensive than normal noodles. I guess this might be an unintended way of cutting consumption though!",4
A2XOZ44TSFNX9N,"I like the idea: I rinsed with water, vinegar, water again. Fishy smell gone. I patted the foodles (faux noodles) dry with paper towels then dry-fried them. I tried with alfredo, olive oil & garlic, marinara, and peanut sauce. I like the idea, they absorb flavors, but the texture was just not good for me. They were just too mushy, even after ""crisping"" them during the dry frying.

If I cook it as some reviewers suggested, longer and with sauce and things, I get something saucy that's all. So taste of the noodle IS the taste of the sauce then.

Out of the bag, they do smell like fish, but that goes away after rinsing them. And yes, the texture is like chewing rubber bands. I have tried all the tricks (boiling for 30 minutes, frying them until they are completely dry), and nothing changes the texture. But the good thing is that they do take on whatever flavor you cook them with, so I try to make them as flavorful as possible!

A31X9PRFWI8OY8,"Great way to help cut carbs.: I had purchased these in the past for myself and loved them. I saw this variety pack and had to try the rice. I will say that when you first open the package you have to be sure to rinse them well due to the awful smell, but one they are rinsed and cooked in the whatever dish you are making they are very good. It is a guilt free way to have your favorite ""pasta"" dish minus the pasta. I have been trying to cut down on carbs and this definitely helps. They take on the flavor of whatever you cook it with. They do have a bit of a different consistency then noodles but very good overall.",5
AJU35GYQKNPJI,This package is horrible.  Complete MUSH.: I have ordered alot of these noodles and have liked them.  These were horrible.  Completely mushy.  I threw out the rest of the packages after sampling each package.,1

AL0QEY0M6U6M0,"Delicious and perfect for weight loss if that's your goal: So delicious.  No idea why anyone would give these a bad rating.  The only problem I have is that they make me too full.  My belly gets extended and I can't do anything for hours.  With that said, if you're using them to lose weight, stop reading reviews and just buy them.  We recently returned from Tokyo where all the woman are skinny minis.  I mean insanely skinny.  One woman told me that konjac (or konyaku) helps them to feel full.  This is the powder of that food.  Works insanely well to help with appetite.  I had to stop consuming because I couldn't eat anything when I'd use any of these products.

Yes, it can smell fishy.  Rinse in a calendar.  Done.",5
AD4TI3BYQ6U7I,"Noodles on a low carb diet?  Yes !!!: My daughter swears by this product.  She's on a (very) low carb diet and there are not many noodle like products which she can eat and keep her carbs to a minimum.  Yes, these noodles smell fishy upon opening.  BUT they do rinse up nicely and serve as an accompaniment for sauteed veggies and as a decent side for London Broil, baked chicken and the like.  The different varieties are nice for eye appeal and texture.

AHL0MILCCHBAR,"I just can't go on :): If you've had the bean-based noodles called ""glass noodles"" you have an approximate idea of the texture of the Miracle Noddles, which have a slightly crunchy, almost cartilaginous bite to them. This I wouldn't mind but I have a hard time digesting ""glass noodles"" and unfortunately I get the same queasy feeling eating the shirataki noodles. At first I thought it was that I'd eaten the whole package (in my favorite spicy broth) but I tried it again with marinara (not bad flavor-wise) then again in broth but half the amount of noodles and got the same queasy feeling. Too bad as this was an excellent idea. I may try the kind with tofu but am a bit afraid of feeling queasy again.",3
A14EC4CJW37J4V,"Takes flavor of anything else: Has the texture of glass noodles with no flavor. Will take on any flavor. Not hard to cook just needs lots of flavor added. Great for things like pad Thai, orange chicken and stir frys. Not so great for things with little to no flavor.",4

ACFCGAVKNJCYK,Yuk: So wanted to like this but right out of the box I was repulsed. Tried to give it away but no takers. I will stick with low calorie vegetable noodles that take a little work but actually look and taste like food.,2

A29RZ4B73I2X8H,"but they really are good. They don't have any flavor: I was skeptical about these, but they really are good.  They don't have any flavor, but they have a nice texture and they soak up the flavor of whatever you put them in.",5

A219S7263AL21F,"Great idea, rubbery noodle: While this may be tasty for some, I prefer my pasta al dente and this product has the texture of a majorly overcooked noodle.

A1C1BNSD2158A7,"just ok, still rubbery: I thought the flavor would make the Shirataki noodles taste a little better.  It really did nothing for me. I do prefer Miracle noodle brand, however, because it is Soy-free. You just have to get used to the rubbery texture of this faux pasta. A fairly decent alternative if you are trying avoid gluten/wheat/grain.",3
AOLMWKBUF312G,great for the low carb life style: I am no/low carb lifestyle and also very Italian so the two don't go hand in hand. I LOVE pasta and this item is a great alternative for me :) i will say it is better when u let it sit in the sauce overnight I think it picks up the flavor more. The noodle can be a little gelatin like but don't have a flavor to them really.,4

AFC1M0HX0XJ8U,"It's a noodle for diabetics!: After my husband was told he was fighting Diabetes type 2 it was difficult.  We opted out of all bread,rice,pasta,potato for several months.  We really missed pasta & rice a lot. I found this product and it's changed our diet back to more exciting meals. Make sure to rinse the product well. I soak it with spices after the rinse and before the 5 minute simmer. Sound like a lot of work? No, it's actually way less prep time than other noodles!",5
AMM3BMOBRYECO,Four Stars: Tastes okay - a bit pricey,4
AWTX2NP1U0MTS,"Filling and versitale.: I love these noodles. I use them several times a week and they are an integral part of my low-carb eating lifestyle. They do not taste like traditional noodles or rice,, but have a nice texture and will absorb any sauce or broth they are cooked in. Very filling and the package is just right for two servings.. You can overindulge with no guilt. Very filling. I will have some with marinara sauce and left over hamburger for lunch.",5
AY5OFI4WJEKHU,noodles: I wanted a noodle without a lot of sugar to these work great in the meals that are pasta meals.,5
A2QPX6FYLKGSRC,"Really ODD, and totally INCONSISTENT!: I ordered the 6-pack of Miracle Rice, without ever trying them anywhere first.  When I opened the box, I noticed only one package looked like it had any ""rice"" in it, the other 5 looked like mostly water, with a very small amount of product.  I cooked the full-looking one first, thinking maybe the others would be the same once opened, but it was not to be the case - the difference in amount of finished rice was radically different!  I only know this because eventually tried another package, and it was nothing like the fuller looking package....only about a half-cup of finished ""rice""!

As for smell/flavor, when I first opened it, it smelled really fishy.  After boiling for 2 minutes, the smell went away, but the texture was really odd - like tiny gelatinous blobs, with no real flavor to speak of.

I definitely can't recommend these, and wouldn't order again.",1
A2O48CPHOTY349,"BLEW ME AWAY: I was very skeptical of this product.  I try to do ""low carb"" and ""paleo"" but sometimes I just want some noodles (And not ones made out of squash/zuccini, etc.). I particularly crave noodles of  the asian varieties (pad thai, lo mein, etc.). So, that's what I made with this. I did a lo mein/pad thai hybrid with a couple of soft boiled eggs. BLEW ME AWAY. I would not have known these weren't real noodles if I hadn't made them. They closely resemble pad thai noodles in texture.

I followed the package directions, and also let them simmer in the sauce for a bit. They soaked up a ton of flavor and were really delicious. I felt VERY full, and still do, hours later. My stomach was a little gassy for a bit, but nothing worse than beans.

Give it a go, these are awesome.",5
A3RQ6DBE93RA62,One Star: It was like eating that much tasteless gristle.,1

delicious vegetable diner.  I am very pleased with the noodles and plan on ordering more.",5
A31MAKDCY17ACH,"Great for diabetics!: I control type 2 diabetes with diet and exercise. I love pasta but cannot eat it now. This is a GREAT substitute. You DO have to rinse it quite a lot to get rid of the 'briny' smell, but that was 'forewarned' and I expected that. I made a vegetable stir-fry and used the pasta as the base.
I washed the pasta, drained it, washed it again, drained it, then microwaved it for a minute. Then I put the noodles on the plates with the vegetable stirfry on top. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, and then to my delight I discovered my blood sugars stayed under 120 (7??) when I tested 1.5 & 3 hours later. Pasta (like bread) would have spiked them to 250-300. I will be eating Miracle Noodles and their Miracle Rice for ever now. For ME, they are definitely worth the price, as I did NOT crave pasta after eating this substitution. That is a MEANINGFUL thing to a diabetic.",5

A1NQ2OSI7EDZBH,"Life-changing: These are incredible to me. Anyone who is complaining of a ""fishy"" smell is simply looking for something to whine about. For me, the second I ran them under the tap, any smell/taste was gone. I tried the rice first- if you want my advice, throw it into a hot skillet instead of boiling;it gets some moisture out. I didn't notice any gummy-like texture at all. I simply added butter flavored cooking-spray, salt, and garlic to the skillet and it tasted and felt exactly like sinful, delicious, buttery rice/noodles. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.",5
A3DZDNIKMB0AFP,Love it!: Didn't expect this to taste like pasta.  I've tried the spaghetti squash and other pasta substitutes but none as delicious as this. Love it.,5

A1FFJRP833Y1MH,"Delicious!!: We love all the Miracle noodles but the&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Shirataki Zero Carb Gluten Free Pasta, Garlic and Herb Fettuccini, 7 Ounce&nbsp;is especially great.  Marry it to some canned clams and basil and herbs fettuccine sauce and you've got a quick and delicious meal!  My personal hot tip on using ShIrataki noodles is to heat them separately from you sauces in a non-stick pan and get them dryer.  When they look a little opaque and dull, not so wet and shiny then serve them to put your sauce over or mix them in with the clams and sauce.  Enjoy",5

A2DS4JO5FLESHA,"I like it: Had no clue what to expect but thought I'd give these a try.  All of my questions are now answered as I took a chance and ordered them.  First of all, I will reorder, so that in itself makes a statement.  Yes, they did smell a little bit like fish when I opened the package (yes, they are soft and come packed in water).  I rinsed them thoroughly and the fish smell faded some.  Then I boiled them in salt water per the instructions on the package.  Prepared them two ways - with an alfredo sauce (made with tofu, so low cal and my husband can't tell as it tastes like dairy...he he), and also with a marinara sauce.  It was good both ways.  The 'noodles' seem to want to 'tangle' up together into a wad...and they do not break easily, but do cut easily, even with a fork.  One of my main questions was, do they expire?  Yes, they do, and there is an expiration date on each package.  I purchased this product in January 2014, and the expiration date on them is November 2014.  Serving three people (we are not large eaters) we really only needed two packages of noodles, however, I used three packages and we had leftovers.",4
A3VX6AOKB8SVVK,"Not at all like real noodles - you are better off chopping up veggies and using those as ""pasta"": HORRIBLE. The odor, then the texture, then the taste. Do not waste your money on these ""noodles"". They appear as though they are something out of an Alien movie sequel.",1

A3FK5WWNEANI4Y,"This gets rid of any bad flavor they might retain: I adore these noodles! I rinse them for a minute or two in a colander and then boil for about 3 minutes.

A3IR18HT4QFO1O,"Wow!: I got my noodles today and was so excited.  I purchased the variety 6 pack so I could see which noodles I enjoyed the best.  Today I tried the fettuccine noodles.  I opened the pouch and put them into a colander and rinsed them well.  Then in a frying pan, I put in a T of olive oil, and a spoonful of chopped garlic.  Got that good and happy then threw in the noodles.  I then added some pasta Italian seasoning.  I added a splash of fat free half and half, and let that simmer together nicely.  If I had been preplanning I would have cooked up some vegetables, like onions, peppers, pea pods, anything I could find that is tasty and put that in with the noodles and I would have had an enormous platter of food for practically no calories.  But, I was in a hurry......  The results were:  I enjoyed it a lot.  For those of you who want the taste of REAL pasta, this is not for you.  What it tastes like is Asian noodles.  I have had a dish similar in Chinatown in NYC, with grilled shrimp on top.  Now there is something I shall try next time.  I will continue to keep these noodles in stock.  Great food, simple to prepare and next to nothing calories.",5

(which I love an miss dearly)  I placed the remainder of the pudding in the refrigerator for a few hours and tried it again. Cold was wonderful as well.  This rice in this form was akin to tapioca, but I have rinsed and dried out more to make chicken and rice tonight! I'm in heaven .  I did not find the smell to be yucky or offensive in any way.

The mostly bad thing is that I have 5 more packages that are going in the garbage. So yeah, maybe find them at a store and try one package to see if you body is okay with these noodles. Mine said ""NO"".",2

Also, I just figured out, when I eat them for dinner, I had to get up during night to pee. I was thinking it's because of my age as I'm 51 years old. I had a gap of one week without this rice as I had to return the package for quality issues. During this one week period, I didn't have to get up during the night time. May be it's just me.",3

A3QKWSE20VJBRS,"This stuff is GREAT!: These no-calorie noodles are great, once you understand that a little preparation is needed prior to eating.
1.  Open the package over a sink and colander.  Ignore the scent - that will go away with proper preparation.
2.  Rinse the noodles with water.  Drain well.
3.  Dry the noodles in a non-stick pan over medium heat.  This takes about 5 minutes.  Stir the noodles to speed the drying process.
4.  Remove from heat and use immediately, or store in an airtight container until ready to use (refrigerate).  The seaweed smell will be gone.
Need a quick recipe?  Read on...
In the same pan, add 2 cups of vegetable broth (or chicken, or beef).  Stir and heat on medium.  Add any frozen or fresh, chopped veggies you like and simmer for about 5 minutes. Then sprinkle on Chinese Spices, which is a powdered mixture that can be found in the average grocery store, in the herbs and spices section.  Add soy sauce...1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (whatever amount tastes best to you). Add a few drops of Sriracha sauce if you like some heat.  Optional topping additions:  fresh cilantro, sliced hard-boiled egg, chopped sweet pepper, sliced almonds...or whatever you like.  This creates a very low calorie but filling meal!",4

Upon opening the package I was hit in the face with what can best be described as a smell similar to the rotting infected anus of a dying coyote. The consistency of the noodles were equally disgusting and they tasted like the intestines of someone who had recently died from Ebola. Honestly the only thing Miraculous about these noodles is that I didn't shoot myself in the face 1.2 seconds after my first bite. They should be removed from entire Universe in effort to save people the misery of what everyone who is dumb enough to buy them goes through .....Good Luck though if you get them",1

A3UZ6W5MMZVHK7,"If you are cutting carbohydrates these help, but they caused me severe gastric distress.: As someone who needs to stay on a low carbohydrate lifestyle, eating plan, whatever you want to call it, I decided to give these a try because regular ramen noodles made from grain have too high a carb load for me. These are truly guilt free because there are zero carbs to count!

Now, my reasons for the rating of one star is the texture. The texture is quite chewy, almost rubbery and takes some work to eat. I had hoped after all the prep and cooking it would be softer like a thick soba noodle but it is quite firm.
They are work to prepare: rinse, boil, heat in dry pan...all before you use them in a dish.

The noodles also rest better on my stomach than regular pasta, and I eat a full pouch in one sitting.

A36W8ELBAMQLV5,"Miracle indeed: These are amazing.  Seriously.

Zero nutritional value.  OK, these noodles have 15 calories/serving.  Gluten-free, carb-free, sugar free, fat-free, free, free, free!

HOWEVER, when compared to traditional wheat pasta or gluten-free brown rice pasta, those 15 calories are meaningless in the face of the  200+ calories/2 oz serving of traditional pasta.  How big is that 2 oz serving?  About the size of your fist.

ODOR:  After rinsing, we don't detect any odor as reported by others.

TEXTURE:  We find these to be the same consistency as traditional rice cellophane noodles, which we love.  If you're accustomed to wheat pasta and Italian fare, and have never eaten cellophane noodles, then there will be a transition.

These noodles aren't anything like wheat pasta and never will be.  They're meant to be prepared using Asian cooking techniques, which are very different from Italian pastas.  These will never be mac & cheese.

TASTE: Zero taste, just like cellophane noodles.  Similar to tofu, these noodles will take on the taste of your sauces, proteins (fish, seafood), herbs and veg.  To really enjoy these noodles, we recommend learning how to cook Asian foods especially Vietnamese or Japanese.

We love the clear broths of Vietnamese or Japanese cooking that infuse a dish with flavor without being gluggy.  All that lovely veg and protein in a deeply flavored, clear or coconut milk broth - lemongrass, chili, cilantro, seaweed, green onion, ginger, fresh vegetables, shellfish, regular fish, pork, beefm poultry and, yes, tofu. Oh, swoon....

We find these to be exactly like the rice cello-noodles in taste and texture.  We rinse them well, cook them off in a pan to remove the liquid and slightly par-cook them,  and then finish them as we would any Asian noodle dish.

Once we work our way through our remaining cellophane noodles, we're never going back to them because of Miracle Noodles.  We don't know what took us so long.

Sure we have calories from our additives, but it's so nice not to heap on calories from the pasta or rice.  Miracle is right!",5
A17ZENTJVXN1K5,"might even be better to let it sit over night or something if ...: ZERO calories, ZERO flavor.

AG15Q1ZXGG7T8,Five Stars: Good substitute for noodles especially when on a keto diet,5
A20BEKN1ZXZ02M,"Great Product: Great Product if you are trying to control your calorie intake.  Since they are calorie and carb free if you add these to one or two of your meals a day you are going to take out a lot of calories AND NOT BE HUNGRY.  I have been eating them for a couple of weeks and have lost weight without going hungry.  You do have to learn how to cook these noodles though.  They have no taste more or less and are gummy sort of so I worked on them and here is my results.  Try it and I think you will make them a happy addition to your weight loss plan.
  Make a strong soup stock in a crock pot....I use the chicken carcass from a roasted chicken from Costco, add some onions and carrots and some chicken soup base ...cook for several hrs. as bone broth is very good for you...remove the bones.  Wash thorough as many pkg of noodles as you wish, my pot will hold six pkgs. and drain really well in a colander.  Let them sit for 10 min. or more then add to the broth.  Cook on low for a few hrs. and then turn onto warm or keep on low if its practical.  I just turn them on warm and let them cook all night.  After 10-12 hrs they change their texture to be more like rice noodles and they have a mild flavor, not strong but some flavor as opposed to cardboard.  Drain them in a sieve or colander until they are dry and then store in the fridge.  Now you can use them in anything, and they are dry enough to hold a sauce.  Following the direction to just rinse and dry in the frying pan just doesn't hack it for me, but it is well worth the effort of the crock pot for the results and weight loss.
  One of favorite dishes is noodles, a tbsp. each feta cheese, , chopped pecans, chives, crispy onions, bacon bits and cherry tomatoes, chop up other veggies or fruit and then one tbsp. of olive oil, salt and pepper.  I have tried them all and angel hair is the best for me.  You have to cook the fettuccini longer to get rid of the rubbery texture.
  Add any sauce you want 14 cup Alfredo is only 70 calories or grated cheese and tomatoes.  Scramble with eggs for breakfast. add to post roast with gravy.
  Keep in mind they have no nutritional value themselves so if you are using these for weight loss then you will need to make sure you get your vitamins and minerals in some other form.  You don't want to just eat these noodles and nothing else as that would not be healthy at all and your body would think it is starving and slow down it's metabolism which is counter productive and shooting yourself in the foot.",5

ABPL31JV08QRS,"Easy to prepare: I read reviews before purchasing, so I was prepared for the briny water smell. And, after rinsing, it was fine. Texture does remind me of rice noodles... maybe a bit firmer than rice noodles? Anyways, nice for variety when you are watching your carbs. Only thing that surprised me was the size of the package. Pretty little! I measured, and one package made a generous one cup. So, in my case, I am cooking for two adults on a low carb diet.  I need two packages of these noodles for say, a spaghetti meal? Three if I am going to eat too. That is pretty costly just for the noodles portion of the meal.
I do think they are worth having in the pantry though. I checked the ingredients and they only had 3 ingredients in them. Water, konjac flour, and calcium hydroxide. I like simple foods.
  I liked the angel hair noodle better than the fettuccini (but, that is just my preference) I thought the fettuccini noodle was so big, that I noticed the fact that it was not the noodles I am used to eating.  But, angel hair was so skinny, it just seemed like normal noodles. Haven't tried the rice one yet.
I will definitely be buying these again. Probably only the angel hair style. (and maybe the rice, depending on how I like it)",5

A1JRBE07EORKML,"Doesn't taste very good!!!!: I tried these because they come in different shapes. I like the idea of the rice shapes. There are much better tasting brands of these type of noodles. There is too much prep work with these noodles. Other brands just need to be rinsed and heated, these need to be rinsed and boiled for for a few minutes before using.

AMQGV7002C0D3,"Learn proper cooking technique!!!!: Okay, ignore the bad reviews by people who don't know how to cook shirataki.  There is a specific way to cook these, or they are nasty.  Rinse for a full minute in cool water or until the weird (but totally natural and normal) smell goes away.  Drain well.  HERE'S THE IMPORTANT STEP.  Dry fry the noodles to the point they are sticking to your pan.  (I haven't burned them yet).  Then add your sauce/oil, veggies/meat, or whatever.  The noodles will immediately release from the pan ftom the slightest moisture.  The noodles will be chewy and filling.  I eat shirataki daily and will never go back to regular pasta.

AJEZKLK7ZPZUR,"Really good!: I have been following a Paleo regiment and the one thing I was starting to miss were noodles. I jumped on the zucchini noodle bandwagon (love it) but its no real replacement for noodles. Zucchini noodles are kind of like noodles. Then i tried Kelp Noodles and let it be known- those things are awful and should not be called a noodle- ever. These miracle noodles were my last resort before going on a pasta binge.
I am happy with them.
First things first, they stink. Yes they do. Dump the entire bag into a collander and get to rinsing. These are a lot like tofu shirataki noodles so they need to be rinsed completely. Once they were completely rinsed, I poured boiling water over them and then dried them with a paper towel. The texture reminds me of yam noodles.
These are not like regular pasta. However, they do satisfy a noodle craving. Due to their texture, i don't think they taste good with marinara sauce or pesto. These are BEST in soups/stews and stir frys. These noodles in my coconut curry stew- perfect- couldn't tell they were noodle susbitutes.
Just remember to rinse REALLY well!",4

AXPDKD6TLMKSZ,Okay: Not bad but I hated the fettuccine noodles,3
A2BY1DRVCVA7DH,"like every other reviewer has said: Ok, like every other reviewer has said, these are NOT like regular pasta.  They are very good for what they are, but they are not regular pasta, and I don't think they're really a viable substitute for it, though people report otherwise.

These are clear noodles that strike me as being most similar to rice noodles or soba noodles.  They come packaged wet, in a brine type solution that yes, smells briney or fishy out of the package.  I followed the directions on the brand's website, rinsed for a few minutes, then boiled for 2-3 minutes, then dry roasted in a cast iron pan to get the liquid out.  I added a mixture of soy sauce, sweet Asian sauce of some kind, and chicken broth, and ate the rice version of them as a side under my peppered pork loin, and they were quite good, though I think I needed to rinse or boil a bit more because they still had a wee tad of a briney smell.

I think the rice variety is better suited to soups than fried rice or lo mein type dishes, it's not really a great rice sub. I'll continue going to brown rice or quinoa to sub for rice, though I'd totally pop these into chicken noodle soup.  I haven't tried the noodle varieties yet.  I wouldn't do these with Italian style pasta sauces, although I guess it's possible the fettuccine varieties might work under a heavier meat sauce.

Are these noodles going to be a daily staple for me? No, but they shouldn't be, either; your body needs more than just the fiber these are made of.  Like I said, I'll still use quinoa and brown rice.  These pretty much absorb the flavor of whatever you put them in, but they are a bit of work and the texture is not regular pasta.  It's more like an Asian noodle texture, which, duh.  I think they'd work best in Asian inspired dishes; pad thai, lo mein, that sort of thing.  They're good, though, you just need to know what you're ordering.

And seriously, rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse.  It's important.",4

A31NY6EBH7LR7W,"Truly a miracle food for your miracle weight loss!: I finally learned how to cook these noodles and they are a low carbers dream.  These are not quite as good as the Shiritaki Tofu miracle noodles, but at about $1 less a package, who cares?  Theres not that much difference.  You must learn how to cook them or you will be offended by them.  The texture is different that a regular rice or wheat noodle, but not offputting.  Empty the package in a strainer and rinse, rinse, rinse.  I then put mine in a tupperware container and soak and about every 20 minutes or so rinse and re-soak.  Sometimes I leave overnight in the fridge, just depends.  When there is no fishy smell (no they have no fish products, its just the liquid they are in) pat them dry and dry out in the microwave for about 2 minutes.  Then use however you wish in place of regular noodles.  I usually make an asian noodle bowl with a homemade sugar free teriyaki sauce, fresh veggies and grilled chicken or shrimp.  I''ve even put marinara or meat sauce on them.  When you are trying to lose weight sometimes you just need to sit down to a big plate of hot food and eat until you are full.  These noodles allow you to do that and fill completely satisfied.  I bought a case of these several years ago and finally threw them away because I didn't know how to cook them.

Then, pour off the fluid that came out of them while hearing, and dry then with paper towels. If you do this, you won't taste that stank. They really will be like rice noodles (the kind they out in pad Thai) and you will feel like you're eating a real noodles, with truly no carbs. Very satisfying to my mouth, which takes such joy and pleasure in eating pasta. Spaghetti sauce, yum! Asian style, yum!",4
A2MZOXEKFFDWZR,"Great for low calorie, low carb or no gluten diets!: I think the reviews on here are funny, and some people get so dramatic about the flavor.  IT'S NOT THAT BAD, PEOPLE!!  Yes, the initial odor is a tad ""fishy,"" but it's truly not that bad unless you absolutely hate any sort of fishy/seafood smell.  I was personally doing a low-calorie HCG diet and that's how I stumbled across these noodles, but I think they're great for people who are simply looking for a low calorie/carb-free noodle or are on a no/low gluten diet.  I did a lot of research to determine how to properly cook these, and there are two main methods I found:

1. Strain the packet of noodles into a colander and rinse well with warm water.  Add noodles to a pot of water, bring to a boil and then strain.  Rinse with warm water.  Add back to a pot of water and bring to a boil, strain and rinse one last time in warm water.  This nearly 100% eliminates any smell, and the product itself has very little flavor.  Now you can use the noodles as directed in your recipe.

2. Strain the packet of noodles into a colander and rinse well with warm water.  Put noodles on paper towels and pat dry.  Add a little oil to a saut&eacute; pan and add the noodles.  Spread the noodles out and let cook 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Then use as directed in your recipe.

I personally found the first method (2x boiling) to be my preferred and I felt it eliminated the fishy smell more effectively.  I simply boiled the noodles 2 times while cooking other parts of the meal.  I made a homemade ground turkey tomato sauce to put on the noodles, and both my boyfriend and I thought it was very tasty!  Yes, the texture is a little chewy as some reviewers have mentioned, but with the addition of ground turkey (or meat, in general) you tend to not notice it.  I think adding foods with texture is key!",4

These noodles are nice since they are no calorie and also help you feel full. However do not think of them as a direct substitute for all noodles.

Use the descriptions like ""Fettuccini"" and ""Angel Hair"" just to gauge the size and shape of the noodle. If you think you are going to make awesome spaghetti with red sauce with these, think again.

Like many other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of asian dishes do well with these noodles. I would say dishes that use rice noodles will be fairly safe with these noodles.

A1CY4WAO8ZQVAM,"Astonishingly good, but do your research!: Like most other people, I was a little nervous about trying these noodles. Honestly, I'm seriously impressed with how good these are!

Pros:
- They absorb flavor REALLY well. The longer they sit in a sauce the better.
- They are very filling. I've made my own version of ramen twice now with these noodles, and I've come away very full. This is a great contrast to the normal ramen. I could eat two bowls of the carb-y ramen before getting satisfied.

Cons:
- They take some special prep which adds some cooking time. This isn't really a huge deal unless you were specifically looking for a fast low carb option for noodles.
- The texture is a little off. This is to be expected, and it's not really unpleasant. The noodles just have a little bit of a chewy texture. To help with this, I boiled mine for 3 minutes, and then fried them in a pan before adding them to my dish. It's still not perfect, but really quite good.

I did some research and I suggest other potential buyers do the same. The general consensus is that you really need to rinse these noodles for 3-4 minutes under cold water to remove any flavoring form the liquid that they are stored in. As far as how to cook them, that's up to you. Get creative! Find your favorite way!",5

Once you rinse the noodles and toss in a pan with whatever sauce you are using there is NO fishy smell or taste.  If you have been wanting a good pasta substitute do not hesitate to try these noodles.  There is a slightly more ""slimy"" texture (hate that word but can't think of anything else) but once they are mixed with other veggies/meat you really don't notice it.

However, once you'd done that, they have no odor and no flavor.

The one remaining problem is that they aren't hard like regular noodles or rice, but slightly squishy.  This doesn't bother me at all, but my wife can't tolerate the noodles because of it.  She loves the rice, though.

My current favorite thing to do with this is to rinse them, then throw them in a frying pan and cook them a few minutes.  Then I throw in some herbs and spices (seasoned salt, steak and chops grinder, garlic, etc) and some kind of meat.  For some asian taste, use some soy sauce as well.  It tastes awesome that way.

A3F6XUKRV9BCRF,"The noodles are not bad. Like it is mentioned in every other comment: The noodles are not bad. Like it is mentioned in every other comment, the noodles smell like fish. More specifically, they smell like the shrimp section of the fish market with a hint of a chemical like after smell (if that' actually a thing). In terms of preparation, I washed the noodles for a long time in a strainer until most of the smell was gone. I washed the noodles for like three or four minutes to be honest. Then I got a pan and just heated the noodles up on a dry pan. After this, I mixed it with some regular red pasta sauce and ate it. In terms of taste, it does not feel like I am eating pasta. It is not bad, Something about normal pasta enhances the taste of the sauce (or the other way around) which does not happen with these noodles. It just tasted like sauce. If you are curious, I think you should try it. I made one packet but I really have not desired to make another. Again, it was not bad tasting. It just didn't feel satisfying. It did fill me up (so I ate like the whole package that's probably why) so I guess its not bad if you are trying to lose weight. The portion in one packet is very small in my opinion, Like I said, I ate the whole packet and it contained multiple servings. My roommate had a good point that there was no nutritional value to these noodles. It made me realize that I wasn't really saving that much in terms of calories, and there was no real benefit to the noddles for my health. So that's probably why I haven't ate them again. But again, if you are curious like I was, give them a try. It might be for you.",3
A2FRFG4ZEIOPZN,"Tapioca?: I just got my order of miracle noodles today. It arrived in good shape. I prepared the rice. First of all, the smell was not bad. Canned salmon has a much stronger smell. I followed the directions on the bag and the ""rice"" came out great. It has no flavor. It looks and has a mouth feel exactly like tapioca.",5
A10XJ90UZ53WJ1,"Not for every taste: This my personal review though, I didn't like the texture of the noodles, to rubbery for my taste. I still ate a whole package of fettuccini, but was hard for me. I really wanted to like this Lol.... but nah I can't deal with that texture. Other than that I was waiting to smell that mega nasty smell everyone complains about, and I mean it doesn't smell like bacon when you open the package, but  it's not that terrible, all you have to do is rinse with cold water, and cook in boiling water for some mins. Once prepared the smell is 100% gone. But if you are picky with the consitency/texture of food, I highly recommend sticking to zoodles. Hope my review help you!",1

AHYDR0SD654ZT,"Surprised with the results! Definitely Recommend.: I was very skeptical about these reading other reviews. I found a review of this and a couple others on YouTube and the guy said to make sure to rinse for 2-3 min, par-boil for 2-3 min and then dry fry them until they squeak when pressed - again another 2-3 min. Between the boiling and dry frying I left them out on a towel to dry even more.
My recipe was shrimp Alfredo, and I honestly could hardly tell it wasn't whole grain pasta. There was a little bit of a firmer texture, like al dente pasta, but I like my pasta that way so it didn't bother me.

A2CEERUF9UVA2E,Good!!: Let me say these are amazing... I was so worried after some of The reviews said the smell is horrible... Out of the bag they have a light fish scent but once I rinced them really good in cold water that went away! I cooked them for 6 mins in boiling water after some of the reviews suggest boiling them longer to soften the texture.. Let me say 2 bags made me two meals but I mixed the noodles with other stuff... I used half a jar of light Alfredo sauce chicken and broccoli for the fettuccine noodles and for the rice I used the other half of light Alfredo sauce ham cubes cheese .. Onions and cooked in a casserole dish with bread crumbs on top.. For the angel hair I had use turkey meat balls and light tomato sauce plenty of seasoning!! Wow ... Did the trick for me... The only difference I noticed was the pasta had no flavor an was a little chewy ... Other then that perfect... Basically the same thing really helpful I you are on a diet!! I will by buying agian.. I really enjoyed the rice and fettuccini the best... Good substitute... Takes on te flavor of whatever u make it with... Plz try...

But don't let that scare you away, they are good in their own way, and if you cook them properly.  Before use, it helps to rinse them and boil them for 10 minutes to get the preservative odor and flavor out.

Noodles are now odorless, firm little strands of calorie-free goodness, ready for a spicy tomato sauce, a stir-fry, or adding to a yummy, brothy soup.  The secret is seasoning, because they have zero taste to go along with the zero calories. These will never be like the tender egg noodles you expect in a rich alfredo sauce, but as a substitute for noodles under a hearty tomato sauce, or as a substitute for ""glass"" noodles in Asian dishes---for zero calories, these little miracles are hard to beat. The secret is seasoning! When I use them as pasta in Italian dishes, I add some dried Italian seasoning along with the lemon juice. For an Asian stir fry. I add a little five-spice seasoning to the water. They will never replace pasta. They are a little toothy in texture.

I then boil them in a little bit of seasoned water until ALL of the water is burned off, and then dry fry it for about five minutes. The texture is definitely still not like rice, but it works in places where rice works. I eat mine under a salmon steak with veggies, the oils from the salmon mix it and it's delicious.

Full, and happy that my entire dinner was like 250 calories I went to bed. I woke up this morning with horrible painful stomach bloating. I didn't have time to worry about it so I headed to work. By lunch time, now nearly 15 hours from when I ate I was still full and painfully bloated. So I did some quick internet research and discovered that eating more than a single serving is actually quite dangerous as these ""miracle"" noodles turn to a gel like substance in your stomach and swell, absorbing up to 70 times their weight in water.

Whereas previously, the product looked like gelatinous balls suspended in a water solution, some bags looked like those balls were shredded.  In addition, the liquid to content ratio was off.

A1XZC3BTDRBWFL,"Prepared properly these are an amazing additition to meal options!: These are awesome when you take the time to prepare them properly.  I also purchase these locally from the Korean grocery store- they are fresh and less ""fishy"" for the same price but you don't get the shelf stability. The trick with yam noodles is to rinse well in cold water, cook in a colander sitting over a bowl in the microwave for 2 minutes (to collect the water that drains out), and repeat the entire sequence of rinse, drain, and cook 3 times and you will lose the odor and the rubbery texture. I even do this when I am adding to soup, because the texture improvement is amazing. This will also solve the weeping issue when you use the noodles like pasta and will be adding a sauce that you don't want watered down.  However, my favorite way to prepare these is under super spicy Thai green curry chicken. I make it with decadent coconut cream and low carb vegetables for an amazing low carb meal that rivals any restaurant.",5

A25GMM7DXWK243,"Absolute keto lifesaver: I've been doing keto for several months and down 60 pounds. I've found a keto replacement for almost every food, from sweets and bread to pizza and tacos. The one difficulty I've had is with pasta and rice. Cauliflower rice just isn't the same. These noodles are amazing! I haven't eaten them by themselves but have had them with Rao's pasta sauce and made a mac n cheese and they're absolute perfection. Haven't noticed any smell and people complaining about it seem to be extremely picky or maybe very sensitive to smells because I loooove them and you learn to live with small differences in order to live a healthier lifestyle. The absolute best part is no carbs and 0 calories!!! Can't beat that with a noodle.",5
A1TUXYX713SADT,"Not a ""miracle"" but not horrible either: These were OK but I do believe there is a ""learning curve"" to cooking with them. They are definitely not a ""miracle"" noodle though.

I didn't mind them but my family didn't care for them at all so I will continue to use other healthy pasta choices instead of this one.",3

A3CU9UQ7MGV3YK,"Great stuff for dieting but nothing like rice: I really like this product because it's totally calorie free substitute for rice or macaroni in dishes.  It is NOTHING like rice, however.  It is more like tapioca...soft, slippery little balls that have no flavor themselves.  Makes good mac n cheese without the mac :)",5

Some of you may not like the original smelling of Shirataki noodle but really want to give another try.. Actually, besides pasta, You can use this to make chow mein or yakisoba with sauces.
First, prepare it as the instruction told. In the same time, heat up a pan to a really high temperature.
Second, put dried shirataki noodle into the pan without oil..Put 15ml sauce onto it and 'fry'.

Now you get your tasty noodle! Some sauce are really low in calorie. I recommend yakisoba sauce, shacha sauce and doubanjiang.",5
AE1625UC4E870,No Odor: These cook up quickly. They have no odor and really no taste. I'm on a no carb diet and they are giving me that needed texture so I don't miss what I can't have. I cook up in broth and enjoy!,5
A1VUUTDNHFQKOB,Awesome: When not eating carbs these are a great substitute. They absorb the taste of what they are cooked in. I highly suggest them.,5

A1A45NTDOME6F9,Its good incentive for me to make really tasty sauce: These stink to high heaven until you rinse them. Its just the natural odor of the plant root but whoa. Husband says they have no flavor it just gives him the impression that he's eating pasta when the rest of us have pasta.  Its good incentive for me to make really tasty sauce!  LOL,4

A2X031MLDHJT2Z,"What to do with the leftover unopened packages?  Can't eat them!: Yuck.  I realize these would not be like regular pasta and didn't expect them to be.  That is why they get two stars instead of one.  They stink terrible like dead fish.  Yes it does go away after rinsing and boiling, but gross.  The taste?  There isn't any. It just takes on the flavor of your sauce.  However, the texture is just not good.  Like squeaky chewy rubber bands in your mouth.  Chew and chew and chew to cut up the very long ""noodles"" into something manageable to swallow.  By this time the sauce flavor is gone and you just have tasteless rubber in your mouth.  Keep chewing.  Even my husband, who eats everything I make and is not the least bit picky, finally said, ""If I have to chew any more of these I will gag"".  Bummer is that they were expensive, and I have 5 more bags left that I do not think we will ever be able to eat or give away in good conscience.  We have tried this type of noodle before in another brand, and they were surprisingly not bad at all.  So a big disappointment with this brand.  Not even close.",2
AXILLM6X32FC4,"Calorie free and filling: Do these smell fishy if you take a whiff of the unprepared noodles? Yes. If you don't put your face up to the open package, you won't have a problem.

You HAVE to follow the directions and there will be NO SMELL. Rinse in cold water, boil for 2 minutes, drain and place in pan on medium:high heat until dry = done.

Would I eat these solo? No. They Obsorb flavor and are great for stir fry or covered in pasta sauce with veggies and or meat.

Don't fool yourself, this is not pasta and the texture is totally different but it's calorie free, seriously. ZERO calories!!!! They are a great alternative for those watching what they eat.

Will I buy again? Yup! This is my 2nd or 3rd time buying these noodles!",5
AHWQCZHQC06WM,Five Stars: These are awesome if you follow the directions no calories no carbs,5
A6LAYAXY74AMU,"something DEF WRONG with these noodles.: let me first start by saying i have eaten these noodles on and off for over 5 YEARS. i know they smell fishy, thats the lime (chemical, not fruit) necessary to keep them shelf stable and hold the noodles shape. they haven't gone bad and it won't hurt you. you rinse them for a few minutes, then dry them out in a dry, hot saut pan to steam out all moisture, then use in your recipe.

when i got this latest batch of angel hair noodles (1/18/18) something definitely seemed off. instead of the noodles filling the package like normal, it was mostly water. the noodles were all kinky and shriveled up and in a tiny little ball. no WAY there was 7 ounces of product in there. i cooked it anyway, and it tasted ok (basically like nothing, per usual), but the texture was crazy. like dried up rubber bands or something. i will be getting my money back and re-ordering from a different site. thrive markets miracle noodles were just fine and i got those about 3 months ago. im wondering if someone has actually tampered with this product and until i can receive confirmation that this won't happen with the next batch, i will definitely not be reordering from here.",1
A30Q19VN5I9HC2,"Delicious and part of nearly every dinner I prepare!: I absolutely love these noodles!  I had heard about them months ago while participating in a Ketogenic forum, yet no one really explained what they were, and I am guilty of not asking.  I order this pack in which it has the fettuccine, the rice and the angel hair.  Maybe I was desperate for pasta (but I don't think so!), but these are friggin' awesome!

I take them out of the bag, put them in a collander, wash them for a minute or two and let them drain.  Then, in a sauce pan, I heat up some ghee or butter (ghee is better since it doesn't burn), and I get my spices ready.  Before putting the noodles in the pan, I pat them dry lightly on a paper towel and put them in the skillet.  I add spices, which is how I would flavor ANY pasta or rice, using spices like cayenne, curry, cumin, paprika, turmeric, chipotle, (and Himalayan salt!), and I might add some coconut milk and almond butter, or make PB2 and add it as if it were a pad Thai dish.  I ""cook"" the noodles for about 10 minutes until I get the desired consistency in the sauce that I want.

If you know how to work with spices, these dishes can be the MOST delicious addition to your dinner EVER!!  I also read where someone said the fettuccine was chewy, or like rubber, and I didn't find that to be true at all.  Then again, I do not microwave these noodles - any of them - I put them in a skillet.  The ""rice"" makes a little side dish, but tastes nothing like rice to me, but it doesn't matter.  It's still delicious!  What's BETTER than being low to basically zero carb, guilt free, almost indistinguishable from pasta, but zero calories and glucose load?!  YUM!  Eat up!",5
A33CKFS6S35I4U,"The trick is to stir fry it: I know there are a lot of debate on the smell and taste of the Shirataki noodles. One way to make them tasty is to:
1) Rinse it with water first
2) Stir fry them with your normal paste ingredients or chinese noodle fry ingredients
Give it 5+ mins of stir fry, make sure they are soaking in the lovely sauce for a bit while you are stir frying it!

If you love chinese takeout but don't want to load up the extra calories, here's what i've been doing:
I like eggplant with garlic sauce, so I take some of that and heat up in the stove, then dump rinced Shirataki noodle in the same pot, constantly stir around to get those garlic sauce on the noodles. 5-7 mins later, i got a eggplant with garlic sauce dish and filling noodle on my plate!  I think same trick works for other chinese takeouts.",5

I ended up throwing out almost the entire meal that I made with these, and then I actually pitched the rest of the bags, too.  I just couldn't see myself eating them again.  (Beware that Amazon doesn't let you return food!)

I am only giving 2 stars because I personally didn't like it, but I would actually encourage other people to try these.  Because if you do like them, they are such a good alternative to pasta and other carbs.",2

A2ABY7J1FW1U2X,Not good: Tastes like rubber fish,1
A2JJ04EE4UREUJ,"These are fantastic for low carb lifestyle!: These are awesome! For the people who do not like the texture, you HAVE to drain and rinse them. Then, dry fry them in a pan. They will not stick or burn, I promise. Dry fry them until it appears most of the moisture has dissipated and the noodles aren't shiny anymore. Then, serve with your sauce or add to your dish. The texture is still a bit different, but my husband and I eat a low carb lifestyle, so for us, these are wonderful! I have made spaghetti, fettuccine alfredo, stir fry noodles, ramen style with meatballs and egg mixed in, and even used the fettuccine style cut up as the base for low carb keto macaroni and cheese! For the stir fry and ramen, I used the angel hair. I don't care much for the consistency of the rice ones on their own, BUT it is FANTASTIC as a rice add in to a dish that would normally have rice in it like cabbage rolls, chicken rice soup, etc. Soooo much better than freaking cauliflower as a rice replacement in dishes! I never hated cauliflower until I started living a low carb lifestyle! Ha ha

If you miss pasta, give it a try and have an open mind! Another thing to keep in mind is that one package is a moderate sized portion for one hungry adult. It is filling, but if we want leftovers for the next day, we have to have four packages total.",5

Totally worth the strange texture and gross smell when rinsing.",5

A338AZVM8KV9E7,"Guilt free, few carbs, needs a strong sauce: These are good.  They are wider and thicker than any fettuccine noodle I've ever seen.  So you need to use them with a thicker, more flavorful sauce.  These do have a fish odor when you first open the bag.  Most of that goes away after rinsing.  It's unnoticeable under a sauce.  I love that these have almost no calories, and no carbs.  They do seem to produce increased intestinal gas.",4

A2BT19BRL79QH7,Meh product: Wasn't super impressed with these noodles. They smelled horrid when I opened them which is in the disclaimer but I wasn't prepared for how horrible. The smell does go away when you follow the instructions. I think these would be good in an Asian dish like pho but I made spaghetti out of them and honestly I prefer zucchini noodles. Not really worth the price in my opinion.,2

Shop in your local Japanese/Korean/Chinese grocery stores and save half!  I'm not sure why they are so expensive online, it's outrageous.  I buy the most expensive packages in store for $1.69 a pack or 6 for just $10.

NOTE: the rice variety is not my favorite.  It's not really shaped like rice, but more like small, perfectly round balls.  Not pleasant to eat.

They're not going to taste exactly like real flour noodles because they're not flour. With that said the smell isn't bad. Other people must have super sonic smell because it's a faint smell and it goes away when you wash them.

Because the shirataki noodles are chewy, the noodle thickness of fettuccine didn't sit right with me. It was way different from eating pasta, but also take into account that it was my first time trying shirataki noodles. I just finished eating the angel hair noodles and after inhaling my plate of spaghetti...I'm in love. I just ordered a case of 6 angel hair noodles. They where fantastic and I wasn't even THAT hungry. I haven't tried the rice yet, but I have a feeling they'll be good. Angel hair all day every day lol! (btw I cooked both angel hair and fettuccine buy boiling them first for probably 5 min and then I drained the water out and let them dry in the pan on, on the stove.)

A1INW03P9CNGJM,"Great low carb insert into any rice recipe.  Makes a delicious stir fry or Mexican night!: Great low carb alternative to rice.  Consistency is a little weird, but it does the trick.

Here's how you prep the rice...

Drained and washed the rice with cold water
Microwave for 1 minute.
Wash with cold water
Microwave for 1 minute
Wash with cold water
Pat dry with paper towels

Then add directly into the pan with your favorite recipe that would normally include inserting cooked rice.  It works best with dishes that have a sauce or spices because the rice itself does not have as much taste as rice.

We just used it for a taco night and it was great!

One of the best applications is substituting it for rice to make an awesome low carb stir fry.  Delicious, really no calorie and basically carb free (make sure you use a low sugar teriyaki or soy sauce and pay attention to serving size on the sauce).

Add stir fry veggies and include some chopped water chestnuts, some red pepper flakes, soy or Braggs sauce, perhaps some shrimp or chicken or whatever protein you desire.  Enjoy.  It isn't rocket science, it doesn't smell like fish, it isn't like rubber bands, but it does have a ""chew"" factor which isn't unpleasant.

Contrary to other reviewers, I find this a very acceptable substitute for pasta, but I have been low-carbing (under 30 per day)for ten years and maybe I've forgotten what pasta tasted like.  It works for me as I am also a type 2 diabetic and love the variations I can come up with by using the Shirataki products whether it is the noodles or the rice!",5

A3C2LY6OGXARUD,"Best pasta replacement ever!: I was a little apprehensive ordering this due to some of the reviews, but I decided the benefit of no calories, no carbs, no sodium, no sugar, etc. outweighed my apprehension, so I bought them and gave them a shot. When I opened the package, I was greeted with the often mentioned ""fishy smell"" that many reviewers hated about this product. However, I followed the instructions and rinsed the noodles in cold water, and then cooked them per the package directions. Between rinsing the cooking, the smell fully dissipated. The texture is slightly ""gummier"" than traditional whole wheat pasta, but not bad. The flavor profile is best described as ""nothing"". They really don't have much of a flavor at all. I made my usual spaghetti meat sauce and put over the top of these noodles, and the noodles soaked up the sauce flavor, so my dish tasted just like spaghetti sauce with no noodle taste, but some noodle texture (and a side benefit of being extra filling with no calories). I even gave these to my 15 year old son who is impossibly picky and carb addicted, and he loved them. He reported they taste like ""chewy water"", and when covered in sauce, he was perfectly content with them.",5

Then put them in rolling boiling water ...: I was skeptical about these noodles at 1st period I have learned after several different recipes that I have used with my miracle noodles that I needed to not only follow their preparation instructions but kick it up a notch. 1st of all wash them in very cold running water for about 5 or 5 minutes while mixing them around to assure an excellent wash. Then put them in rolling boiling water for about 2 and a 1/2 minutes. Strain and heat them on a preheated cast iron skillet for about 10 minutes on low flame. I find this gets rid of all of that strange odor that it's a little bit off putting when you 1st open the package. I have used the fettuccine style noodles chopped up in my famous tuna casserole. I made an awesome keto casserole with these noodles and it was delicious.  I made pho with the angel hair style noodles also delicious.  I even created an excellent recipe for egg fried rice with the rice style miracle noodles. I'm telling you it's all about the prepping of the noodles and preparation of your dish. If you are doing a low carb diet or keto and you're dying for the texture of pasta, then these noodles are well worth it. Like I said before, you have to prep the noodles properly to get the best results.  I've cooked with every noodle they offer.

They are really long so for eating ease, cutting them really helps.

The smell is not *that* bad. I just wish this came in a larger bag. I've got 7 people in my house. I use 3 bags per meal and that gives me a tiny bit of leftovers for the next day.
I really enjoy the spaghetti, angel hair, and the fettuccini. The ziti looks like worms so I don't buy that one. Haven't tried the others.

AQ3UZZ2SYQ5OU,"Amazing Noodles!: I was hesitant on ordering these because of the bad reviews, but I ordered them anyways.
I received them 1 week early and had no issues with my order.
It took me awhile before I actually made them because I was nervous due to the bad reviews.
Well, I made baked spaghetti and it turned out amazing!!
After you open the Noodles you will smell a fishy scent. Once you boil the Noodles the fishy smell goes away completely.
I honestly think some people who gave these bad reviews cooked them wrong or way too long.
I boiled mine in a pot with water and butter. I then drained the Noodles and put them back into the pot. I simmered the Noodles to ""dry"" them. Once I finished doing that, I put my sauce and meat in the pot with the Noodles.
Afterwards, I dumped everything in a square casserole dish, added some cheese ontop, and then baked in the oven. I seasoned everything the same way I would Season regular baked spaghetti. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very surprised when I took my first bite. I will be buying these again and I will stick to the Angel Hair because it's the only one I will end up using most likely.
My oldest daughter is 3 years old and the pickiest child I've ever met. She LOVED these Noodles and didn't complain!
My youngest daughter is 1 and I cut the Noodles up into smaller pieces for her and she also loved them. My husband is also a picky eater and he loves these as well.

These are great for anyone who is doing Keto. For me, Keto is a lifestyle, not just a diet and these Noodles are perfect for getting in my fiber and veggies. I added photos of my baked spaghetti and everything I used, as well as the recipe I made. I would say a serving size is 1-2 cups. I'm not sure. I cooked 2 packages of the Noodles.
I Love, love, love these!!",5

The noodles are different and they take some getting used to but once you learn how to use them they can be a nice substitute....but the rice is a whole different story.

A6WFXT0HUY71O,"Great healthy alternative for noodle lovers on low carb diet: I am so happy I found this product and despite most of the negative reviews I decided to try it. I don't understand when people don't take the time to read the instructions and prepare the noodles improperly but then complain about the bad flavor. If you wash the noodles as directed and prepare them according to the preparation instructions there is absolutely no fish odor. In fact the noodles are completely tasteless making it easy to absorb any flavor you use in your sauce.
I prepared the noodles both ways - according to the instructions and as advised in other reviews using the wince twice microwave twice method. Both worked just fine and removed the odor and cooked the noodles just perfectly. I used some soy sauce, paprika, curry and pepper flakes and made a delicious noodle dish in less than 5 minutes.
I used the rice to prepare the rice pudding recipe. It didn't turn out as good as the real deal but that was expected not so much because of the miracle rice but more so because the sweetener cannot replace the real flavor of sugar in this desert. I still liked it but prefer the noodle dishes I've prepared so far.
These noodles remind me of cellophane noodles or rice noodles or even vermicelli. They do not taste like pasta so if you expect the bread-like texture you may be disappointed. I personally think these are delicious and have already ordered my second shipment.",5

I had to give it away. And by the way, it does have a fishy smell once you open it but it should wash away with a couple of rinses under hot water.",2

I was very hesitant since previous reviews mentioned a fishy smell and bad texture, but hey I'm adventurous and a little desperate.  I kind of held my breath when I opened the bag expecting the worst.  I couldn't smell anything at all.  Put the noodles in a strainer to rinse and sniffed the bag.  A very slight, as someone else described, briny, maybe dusty smell.  Not bad at all. Rinsed the noodles very well and sniffed them.  Nothing.  I tried one, seriously not much taste at all, just plain.  I cooked them according to the directions, and just drained them, then added them to chicken Parmesan. If I closed my eyes I could barely tell I wasn't eating al dente pasta. There is a slight rubbery texture for lack of a better word, kind of like calamari.  I am totally hooked and can't wait to try them in other recipes.",5

A3HKK796A3VN,"Amazing if you know what you're getting into!: LOVE THESE.  PERFECT in pad thai or a pepperoni bake.  The trick is you HAVE to dry them out.  You have to dry them out until they are dry enough to absorb whatever sauce you are putting them in.  They have to squeak loudly.  I don't know who is expecting them to taste like wheat ziti, but they taste exactly like noodles found in common Thai and other Asian dishes.  Better really because I know they are not ruining my diet.  What I like to do is prepare a giant batch (3-4 bags), dry them out until they are very dehydrated, then smother in fish oil, peanut butter, chili sauce, lime juice, and lemon and store in a sealed container in the fridge.  When I am ready for my Asian dishes, they are soooo perfect and full of flavor.  I would honestly prefer these over 'regular' noodles.  I use the Miracle Rice in my drinks, the Miracle angel hair in stir fry, the Better than Rice (another product) for incredible shrimp fried rice or chicken fried rice, and these as mentioned above.

I am already on a low fat low carb diet so this weight gain is strange, and makes me wonder if these noodles really do any good.

It is not really a suitable product to eat on its own, but add some pasta sauce, pesto, or ? and you really cant taste the shirataki at all.

The texture of shirataki pasta is pretty gelatinous... That being said, the angel hair is so fine that it does a noticeably better job at having a past-like texture than any of the other kinds. I highly recommend this product. I am currently trying to loose weight and this product feels closest to that ""magic pill"" than anything else. I still feel like I'm eating pasta and I only have to worry about the pasta sauce. I also struggle because I have to have a late dinner due to my work schedule... And we all know that dining late is ""no bueno"" to the metabolism. Well angel hair shirataki pasta with light pesto or  a little garlic and olive oil plus a small chicken breast is not too bad. It's also very easy to cook (5-10 mins). Don't be scared by the weird smell... It goes away after you cook the noodles following the package instructions.

The mouth-feel is good and they take on the flavor of whatever they are cooked with.  Great in curry and other flavorful dishes.  Not bad with just butter and salt & pepper, even.

A35NGQ4VMHEJOQ,"I tried absolutely everything to make these noodles edible...to no avail: Let me start by saying that I was skeptical of all the horrific reviews out there, I thought it was simply a bunch of people not taking the time to properly prepare these noodles, or maybe trying to pair them with western recipes. So after copious amounts of research on how to prepare them, I was convinced that I could make them appetizing. And let me tell you people, I tried EVERYTHING. I rinsed them for 5 minutes, I dried them, I dry-fried them for 5 minutes, I used them with an amazing sesame sauce recipe and I still couldn't bring myself to eat more than a bite or two. There's just nothing to be done for the gummy, rubber-band-ish texture that so many reviews describe. If you're looking for something to make you feel full for few calories, try a low-sodium broth, if you want a substitute for pasta, try zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash, but don't waste your money, as I did, on this awful product. There are no calories in it because your body can't digest it, and if your body can't digest something, you probably shouldn't be eating it to start with.",1

Follow the easy directions on the package to prepare and you are ready to go.  It's the perfect size package for two people.  We mix them in with our stir fry to give them a little more ""umph"" and it's great.  Very satisfying and filling.",5
A1FDIRY45AXBXT,"I am so incredibly disappointed by this product: I am so incredibly disappointed by this product. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but these are almost inedible.
Initially upon opening the bag, you will smell a foul odor. Others compare it to fish...I wouldn't. But for lack of a better example I guess it's close enough. The smell was upsetting itself as I am a bit picky about what goes in my mouth/body and your reaction is not to want to eat these after you smell them. I ran them under water as the directions advise and that eliminated some of the smell, but not all. I used the Angel hair noodles in a marinara sauce. I did a 50/50 mixture of these noodles with regular pasta, as I want some nutrition, i just want a larger portion without the extra calories. I also did this in case the new noodles weren't fantastic, hoping that doing  a mix would make them more tolerable. This was not the case. I tell you i spent 20 minutes picking out the zero calorie noodles because after one bite I was nauseous and had no desire to ever eat them again.
As others have mentioned, they have  a very gelatinous consistency. One that is very unusual and hard to describe. It's not like gummy worms, but more like how I would guess actual worms feel if you bite into them. The taste is fine, almost non existent and the noodles hold on to sauce OK. I did do some research to find out if there was a better way to prepare them, and some people seem to think that adding a step here or there makes them better and edible. I will give these another go with a different preparation, as I bought a ton and they are very pricey. I have a hard time recommending, but do some research before you buy to see if you're willing to take the risk and try the different prep ideas. I can see how these can help someone who is desperate to lose some weight, because if you douse them in enough sauce and toppings you may be able to mask it.  As of now, the only way that I can see how eating these things will help you lose weight, is by making you lose your appetite.",2

These Miracle Noodles are not exactly like pasta, but they make a good substitute.  Once you get over the smell when you open the package, these are good.  I find that one of the best ways to eat these are to rinse and drain them really well, then put them in a dry pan for a few minutes until they turn clear.  Then I will add whatever sauce I want to them-they take the flavor of whatever they're put in really well.

There is essentially no taste, it definitely isn't anything that you'd deliberately eat... at least, not twice.

I was really excited to try them b/c I'd read other good stuff on them but I just couldn't get past the smell.  Even though I know there's no fish or seafood in the product when you open it there's a strong fishy odor.  I was determined to like them so I moved to the next step in the directions, to rinse the noodles.  The odor was still there but I really wanted to like them so I boiled them in some veggie broth for about 5 min hoping they'd just absorb the taste of the broth.  The smell wasn't as bad after the broth bath but it was still there, and that combined with the texture (think really chewy jello jigglers) I couldn't eat it.  Luckily, since I have 5 more packs of these things, hubby thought they were fine and wasn't bothered so he finished my lunch and will eat them.  I'm not giving up, I'm trying to think of how to get around the smell but for now they're not for me....

You know how hot, drained noodles will dry themselves off by both absorbing and evaporating the water? That doesn't happen, in fact they seem to, after draining and drying, continue to leak liquid until there's a puddle of Shirataki-flavored-water at the bottom of the dish. I wanted to like these, I really did, I first tried them months ago and they will just never grow on me I think.

I decided to give them a try. I ordered the multi-pack, which included angel hair, fettuccine, and rice. My order arrived today, so I decided to make fried rice with the Miracle Noodle Shirataki rice. I followed the directions on the package. It is important that you rinse the rice very well and then after you blanch them, it is very important to drain them well. In a pan, I scrambled some eggs, added chopped ham, onion, garlic, and peas and carrots. I added the well-drained cooked Miracle Noodle rice to the pan and seasoned with sweet chili sauce and a tiny bit of Yoshidas. Wow! It was so good.

They are not the same as real fettucini, by any stretch of the imagination. But if you want a gluten-free, ultra-low-calorie, ultra-low-carb alternative to real fettucini, that will allow you to enjoy more of the delicious sauce you want to serve them in, these are indeed that miracle, as promised.

To remove the strong fishy smell, tip the uncooked noodles into a sieve and rinse thoroughly under running water, then put in microwaveable bowl with lots of fresh water and heat for a few minutes until the underside of the bowl feels hot, then strain. No more fishy smell.

UPDATE: Is it my imagination, or have these actually improved, objectively? It might be that I am just used to them now, but somehow the new batch I have just received is seeming more pasta-like and less eel-like (as someone else described the texture). At any rate if I could increase the number of stars from 5 to 6 I would. I love love love the fettucini miracle noodles. Really superb.

I went to use them anyway and found they were extremely tough and I certainly did not eat them... had to throw them out.  How can I get a refund for these clearly botched packages?  My order does not show this option...,1
A2NEGLQOJRXJXB,"Where Have These Been?!: The rice surprised me the most! The texture is very rice-like, and they provide a feeling of such satiation sans the calories. It's a win-win! I do recommend that you boil these guys for three mins in water, and let them dry a bit before you cook with them. Small price to pay, really, for the advantages these offer.

Tl;dr: y'all need to get on this, thanks.",5
A3HG8T618SISPR,"Unpleasant aroma and texture: RE SELLER: fast shipping, no issues. Thank you.
RE PRODUCT: if food texture is important to you, then this is probably not a good product for you. I found the texture to be completely unpalatable. The precooked aroma is also very unpleasant, though it does go away once cooked. My husband was more tolerant of the texture but agreed that it was not enjoyable so we will not be buying again. It is simply a matter of personal taste.",1
A2BHDYS0HLAVHM,"Good carb replacement: We have ordered this pack a few times. Makes a great replacement for pasta, and is good for my low carb diet. It doesn't have very much taste, but when cooked with domething else it is good. I really like the texture of it too.",5

Despite getting rid of it with rinsing and all the cooking tips I just can't get that sensory experience out of my brain. Blegh.,3
A192FXCAPQDC98,"Great gluten free noodles that picks up the flavor of anything you pair it with.: I was worried at first, bit after draining, rinsing, and allowed to drain while I prepare my sauces.

I found that they are much like tofu in their ability to take on the taste of what they're prepared with, and unlike some reviewers did not find them tough or rubbery at all. My preparation was to rinse & drain them, then put them in a skillet with a tiny bit of oil and some roasted garlic, then serve them with veggies and chicken with a little soy sauce.

I don't think that they'll end up as a major part of my rotation but when I'm trying to stay low-carb and have a pasta craving, they will definitely do the job.",5

A1TDXHM6S7HOET,"Perfection in a bag: These are absolutely perfect in every way.

Just a warning, there is a slight fishy odor when opened, which goes away once drained and cooked. No fishy flavor, it tastes like sea water, to be honest.

The package says to boil but I do not do that.  Drain the noodles, rinse with cool water for about 10-20 seconds, try and strain out the water then add to your veggies, sauce.  The noodle will soak up the flavor of any sauce you add to it just like tofu would.  It has no calories or carbs so you can eat it all the time. I added veggies and tofu to mine and it was delicious!",5

AROYEGGI9Z3FF,"Great taste and great product...if you can withstand the smell.: The smell is really, really atrocious but the noodles themselves are great - they're a fantastic way to curb a craving for high calorie carbs, are super filling and rock at soaking up the flavor of other sauces/foods used in the meal.  Primary complaints:
 The cost (but it's not outrageous since it's not an every day meal)
 The smell (they seriously smell insanely foul)
 They come packed in liquid, which makes storage a hassle and the risk of puncturing the packaging high (which would ruin the noodles and unleash the hellish stink upon an innocent unsuspecting pantry)
All that said, I will absolutely buy them again...despite the assault on my nose...the pros far outweigh the cons.",4

I ate them 5 days ago and my IBS has been raging since. I can't ever eat a bland meal without issue right now.  It is slowly getting better but these might as well have been a death trap.

Both the taste and texture were terrible.  The consistency made me nauseous.  Normally I give things away if I either don't like them or I cannot use them.  I could not finish the small serving I had because it was so awful.  My husband tasted them and he said he would rather starve than eat them.  I threw away the rest of the opened package and all of the unopened packages.  I would not try to inflict that on my worst enemy!,1

True, the consistency is not quite like the pasta you're used to, but if you didn't have to worry about carbs (or gluten, I suppose), you wouldn't be reading this review, so I gather you and pasta are on a 'break'.  These are a great substitute for traditional pasta.  Just make sure you have a worthwhile sauce, and you'll hardly notice the difference.  A note about the aroma: these have a very interesting (read: not exactly pleasant, though I don't really mind it) smell when you open the bag.  I read that's because these are plant based, and that's what you smell when you open them up.  A quick rinse (10-15 seconds) and you hardly notice it.  Well, my mom still did, but she has the nose of a bloodhound.",5
A3BFVM3231V35X,"but I am very happy with these noodles: A little expensive, but I am very happy with these noodles. After reading the reviews, I was worried about the fish smell. But I followed directions - rinsing a couple of minutes, then boiling a couple of minutes. There was a slight fishy smell after, but they tasted fine.

I am using them to make a low-cal soup before eating supper. I simply use the noodles (after the prep) and add Swanson's Thai Ginger chicken broth. Sometimes, I saute some onions and mushrooms in olive oil first and add that as well.  I have also made macaroni and cheese. Tried the fettucini with some pesto sauce and that was awesome.

 It is definitely not pasta in taste or texture, but it works fine. Works best in Asian foods where you are already used to a clear noodle, but very versatile. Glad I came across this and will be buying more when I run out.",5

Not only that, the fiber it's made from is good for you!  Do you expect the taste and texture to be perfect as well?  Never gonna happen.  However, with just a little bit of effort, you can turn the smelly funny textured stuff into the basis for a mouth-watering, gut filling dish that makes healthy eating easy enough for anyone to stick with.

I intend to continue buying this product for the foreseeable future and, unless another seller comes along with an even better price, I'll stick with this seller too.",5
A33U2APE89QQ13,"Its true these are disgusting if made as suggested, but they are delicious if made right!: To those who hated the texture of the noodles...there is a way to fix them!!!  I can't stand these noodles the way the bag suggests you prepare them.  They are gelatinous almost like raw scallops.

Here is how I suggest you make these if you want something that really replaces pasta.

First be warned that they stink to high heaven when you open them.  You have to get as much of that smell off as possible.  Rinse them in hot water until you can't smell them from Arms length.

Then coat them in a thin layer of spice.  The noodles will take on that color and they will look more like real pasta...less transparent.  I use a mix of onion and garlic powder if I want a white flour angel hair look.

Then the trick is to really dry them out.  You can towel dry them before spicing to help further.  But when I'm in a hurry I just throw them in the microwave for 8 minutes and drain and fluff them every two minutes.

I keep cooking them until they are no longer gelatinous.  If I'm unsure I put them in some more!

Just as good as real pasta.  I don't miss the real thing any more.

I only use this method with the angel hair.  Not sure it could help all the varieties.",5
A3J0VW0KVW3UQ,"The smell is awful: The texture and taste is alright the smell is horrible gaging every time I brought it up to my face to eat it.

Waste of money return shipping cost is $10 dollars.

My complaint is only about the disgusting smell.",1
A11PUESCVBQXK3,"TRY THIS!!!: TRY THESE!  I read reviews and got a lot of mixed ideas of what to expect.  One reviewer said they were similar to ramen noodles.  I LOVE ramen but it's not something anyone on a diet would be eating...carbs and fat!
So, I purchased these.  I followed the instructions exactly....I rinsed, I boiled for 2 minutes and then strained and put into a non stick got pan to absorb some of the water.
This is the part that made it good...I bout an oriental ramen pack for 0.17 at the grocery, pulled the seasoning packet out and threw away the ramen.  I sprinkled 1/2 of the seasoning pack over the noodles, then added a bit of hot water to the pan to steam the noodles in the seasoning.  I squeezed a little lime on top and THEY WERE DELICIOUS!!!  I can imagine all kinds of flavorful noodles to eat using this!  Wow....this is cheesy to say, but it's truly a miracle noodle!",5

A7VWBYU1W9MLP,"I love the ""rice""!: I actually love the rice. I've found that the texture is closest to a real carb. The problem is that they call it ""rice"" :).  It certainly isn't rice, it doesn't look like rice, and the texture is all wrong for that. If that's what you're expecting, you won't be happy. I'd say it's closer to a couscous in consistency and texture, but much larger.  Because of the size and shape, it's not rubbery or chewy. I like to do as other reviewers do, and cook it for a while to get the moisture out. Then I simmer it in stock so it's got a good flavor, and top it with meat, an egg, veggies, or whatever I feel like and it's delicious. It really does feel like I'm consuming carbs, and so my cravings are satisfied, and I don't feel like I'm missing out.",5
A3V4BALOTU8VLH,"I like them, resemble bean thread noodles, but harder to chew. Cut them up first.: I purchased this because I am going on the Whole30 diet, which eliminates ANYTHING containing sugar (this eliminates virtually all processed and restaurant foods) ALL dairy, ALL grains, and ALL beans. Also, anything that is alcoholic or cooked in alcohol. Coconut is also forbidden, so I cannot make Panang curry.

And I have to say, I have only used my first bag so far. The noodles resemble bean thread noodles, which I love, but are long and difficult to chew in their packaged form. Cut them up before serving, and be aware that small children perhaps cannot handle the chewiness. So some caution is advised: google these.

I haven't tried the rice yet, but I suspect this is the way to go.",4
A133J2FW4I34J0,"Great!: This stuff is a miracle. Rinse very well for a few minutes, then boil for a couple minutes, then dry fry it in a pan and trim the pasta. I just made chicken pad thai with it. I made my own sauce so the whole meal was low carb. This is becoming a big part of my diet.",5

If you're a texture person like me, these won't work for you.

(I am giving 4 of 5 stars because they just aren't really PASTA - nothing else is!  So maybe I am not being fair...they are probably 5/5 for what they are.

A9WV3W6ODLGM7,"Yum!: So I was really skeptical about these, but I'm on the Metabolic Research diet and was missing noodles. I got these and really didn't have any issues. They do smell fishy when you open them, but as you rinse them and microwave them the smell goes away. For every six ounce package I rinsed, cooked 2 mins in microwave, rinsed, cooked two mins in microwave, rinsed, and placed them in whatever I was cooking them with. I honestly couldn't really tell the difference between the texture of these noodles with the texture of regular noodles. I will say that, for me at least, I found that the noodles get more of a noodle texture if you microwave first and then let finish cooking in your sauce. The first time I had them I just cooked in the microwave, added to my spaghetti, and ate it. It was still good, but last night I saut&eacute;ed them with my stir fry for about 10 mins after microwaveing, and I thought it turned out perfect. I would definitely recommend, just make sure you cook properly!!!",5

A2FT5W0QKZ2P19,"A suggestion and how to prepare: I went to high school in Korea and grew to love a particular dish called Japchae.  I have PCOS, so it was recommended I start a low carb diet.  I was okay with giving up rice and most pasta (still waiting for a low carb mushroom ravioli), but sometimes all I want is a taste of home.  The angel hair miracle noodles are almost the perfect texture.  I bought the variety pack of the rice, fettuccine, and the angel hair.  The rice I used to make sweet coconut tapioca pudding, and I tried to use the fettuccine with Alfredo (I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS). As others have stated, use this product with Asian inspired dishes.  Japchae is very easy. I make it with chopped onion, green onion, egg, sesame seed oil, and soy sauce.

Now, I have experimented with different ways to cook these, and the best way is as follows:
1. Rinse with cold water. I do this for a good minute or two, moving the noodles with my hand.
2. Drop noodles into boiling water. Boil for about a minute. Remove.
3. RINSE AGAIN.
4. Place noodles in a hot pan and stir. This is to help remove some of the water and helps get rid of the ""rubbery"" texture.  This is when I will start to add my sauce, veggies, and meat.  I will continue to stir fry the dish for a few minutes so the noodles absorb the taste.

A1MIQ9VQ1Q6Y9G,"A bit of work but good once prepared: As others have mentioned, these smell fishy. If you follow the instructions, the flavor does not reflect the smell.

I've had these as just butter noodles and with spaghetti and really like them.

The secret is in the plan frying.

In a nutdhell:
- rinse with water
- boil 2 minutes
- strain
- fry to dry

It's this final step where all the yummy happens.

I put the boiled noodles in a strainer, rinse the pan, throw a tbps of butter and some McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning in the pan and finish the noodles.

That makes good butter noodles. Add some spaghetti and meatballs for another great meal.

The initial smell is fishy and strange, but I like the results. A bit more work than pasta, but if you are working on a carb restricted or keto diet, I recommend you give these a try.

A3B9N1XCXXQTJT,"Pretty good even if not pasta.: These noodles have a bit of zing that makes them more desirable than just the plain ones.

A14CEN5VNQLKA1,"Low carb, low calorie: I love these noodles. I've been eating low carb for a year now and miss pasta. Now, there is no way you'd mistake this for regular pasta, but it's great when you want to sit down to a big bowl of noodles and zucchini just isn't going to cut it this time. They are virtually calorie and carb free, so perfect for when you really just want heaping serving - or something that will be a vehicle for a delicious and calorie dense sauce.

I do recommend that you rinse and boil them to get rid of the smell. They consistency works best with soups and asian inspired dishes, but will work with marinara or pesto, too. It's a touch chewy and gelatinous. If I didn't have a dietary restriction, I'd never choose these OVER pasta, when when trying to make healthier choices I'm so glad to have these on hand!",5

They do not have much of a flavor and just add that extra bulk to help you feel more full.  Plus, they are great on fiber. Really, I don't think you will even know the difference.  Then again, its like drinking wine, everyone's palette is different.  Mine just happens to be very diverse.  Enjoy!",4
AIV9VBN098BEH,Follow the directions!: The trick to these is to prepare them exactly as described in the instructions. Boil for two minutes and then dry in a medium hot pan. That resulted in a a nice texture that was enjoyable to eat.,4
AN450SLVM6ELE,"Not for me.: No taste, as expected.  Didn't notice a bad smell.  Didn't like the squishy texture to the point of not finishing my small portion.  I tried the fettuccine with pesto (which I love with regular pasta).  I can't recommend.  I tried because I'm on the ketogenic diet.",1

A32GI953X0LWWI,"Glad I took the risk: Given other reviews I was planning to not enjoy these whatsoever.  I figured, if I get full and manage not to gag then mission success.  With that in mind I was pleasantly surprised by what came next.  It did have a fishy scent when I opened it, but  the 10-15 second rinse in a mesh colander did away with that.  I cooked these into a homemade ramen using sodium free chicken bouillon, and dried vegetable soup mix, all available on Amazon mind you.  For something with almost no calories or salt I was completely blown away.  The noodles once cooked were a lot like glass noodles, which I like quite a bit.  Either way the recipe and these noodles were quick and easy to prepare and I had no complaints with the resultant flavor.  I think even  somebody reasonable skeptical would be pleasantly surprised, just don't let them near the kitchen until they are cooked into a dish and they will be none the wiser.

Bottom line, these noodles really take on the flavor of the dish they are cooked into.  They give it the pasta characteristic but add little flavor of their own.",5
A6APR189756YX,One Star: Not at all what I expected.,1

The smell was a little like you get when you open a can of tuna fish - strong at first, but it quickly dissipates and when rinsing with cold water, the smell goes completely away. Gives me another option on those days when I need to be carb-free to keep my blood sugar in check, but want something yummy to eat for dinner. I will purchase again.",4
A1JVQVFOD1AFVU,Spinach noodles -  yum!: I've been eating the fettucine noodles for about a year now.  I just tried the spinach and I love them!  I usually don't like spinach but these noodles are good without any sort of broth or spice to make them flavorful.

Just rinse them off though. I usually place them in a skillet and cook/mix them with shrimp/sauce. There's really no flavor to them and they have a slightly strange texture.

A31GYNS7OWJRFD,"Tasty! Follow instructions and pair them with Asian style sauces and preparations. (NOT Italian): I was pleasantly surprised by these noodles and I hope and pray that they truly are as low calorie and carb as they claim.
The people complaining about the smell need to calm down.  Yes, they do smell a little fishy when you open the package, but once I rinsed them off it was not a problem.
The directions may seem like a lot of little steps, but it goes really quickly.  Rinse, then boil for 2-3 min, drain, then dry in a skillet for 2-3 min. It goes fast.  I used that time to saut&eacute; some shallots.
I added sweet Thai chili sauce and chili paste to the noodles along with the shallots.  It was delicious and filling and although the package says that there are 2.3 servings in a package, I think it would be more accurate to say 2 or honestly ONE.
I WOULD NOT use these noodles for an Italian meal.  It's NOT PASTA.  These are ASIAN STYLE NOODLES.  Perfect for Thai, Japanese, Chinese, etc. meals.  Asian noodle meals are all about the sauce that you put on them.
Again, I hope and pray the calorie and carb count is accurate because I bought  these to help me feel full while sticking to 500 calorie diet days.",5

A24T532TFWAGYG,"Great Alternative For Fellow Low-Carbers Or Keto Dieters!: Many hours spent on YouTube looking at some new low-carb recipes that I can start making introduced me to these Miracle Noodles. I had never heard of them in all the years I've done low-carb and I was excited to try them.

Full Disclosure: I have only tried one of the three versions from this variety pack. The Angel Hair pasta is so far the only one I have tried.

Cooking the ""Pasta"": From what others have advised from YouTube, in order to take most of the slimy feeling out of the noodles, it's best to disregard the cooking directions found on the package and instead do it this way; rinse noodles in cold water in a colander for close to a minute or so. Then heat up a non-stick frying pan and place them in there. Stir on med-high heat until most of the moisture is out of the noodles. Don't worry, this won't actually fry them up and make them crispy. This only removes the moisture and therefore lessens the amount of slim that are naturally found in this product. Once you're finished with that, you can now add any sauces or veggies or anything else you plan to add for your recipe.

Taste: Even doing that frying trick, the noodles were still a bit slimier than traditional angel hair pasta so it won't be a perfect taste match to your favorite pasta dish.

Good Alternative: For the stats; 0 calories, 0 carbs this is the BEST substitute for those of us on a low-carb or keto diet plan. Even traditional low-carb pastas can't claim to have 0 calories and 0 carbs like Miracle Noodle can. So these are perfect if you plan to eat ""pasta"" more often than once a week. If you only eat pasta occasionally then eating the low-carb traditional pastas would probably be better since those actually are noodles just made with alternative flours instead of white flour. But, if you're like me and you enjoy rice and pasta a few times a week than the Miracle Noodle and Miracle Rice may be the best route to take.",3
ATMDVKBZYNKND,"accept the texture: I used the texture for what it was by making a dessert with a package.

I prepared the 'rice' by straining & rinsing until the water was clear.  Then I put them into a mixture of black cherry concentrate & sugar & let them soak 12+ hours, refrigerated.  Then I boiled off most remaining liquid, cooled again, & added to a well-drained 20-oz can of pineapple tidbits,  I combined them right before serving so the colors wouldn't run.

Another idea I'm going to try:  cocoa powder, ground cinnamon, sugar & non-fat ricotta.",4
AL8YCNHN0TLJ,"I hated the smell when I opened the package: Key to this stuff is FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS and rinse them first!!!
I hated the smell when I opened the package, but that went away upon rinsing them off.

I rinsed them, quick 1 minute in boiling water and tada, smell gone.
They literally have no taste if you follow the directions, so they will pick up the taste of whatever sauce or juice you mix them with.

Great way to get that pasta fix (yeah, it's mental) and no carbs to go with it.

No stomach issues or anything that I had after eating them.",4

Rinsed as instructed; then pasta is placed in a bowl.  I add Spinach, Sesame Seeds, Ginger, Garlic, some grinded Black peppercorns and water. Put the contents in a microwavable bowl and microwave for 5.5 minutes. Then add cooked Sprimps, Saltine Crackers and, Viola.
Yummy for my Tummy and it tastes superbly good...... Highly recommend.",5

It is a little rubbery but I don't mind that these kind of noodles/rice are. I cook rice dishes for my spouse and use seasonings and sauces from his to flavor this""rice"". Works pretty well. But there is a brand that has a little oat flour mixed in and you get 3 servings per pouch!  And they have a better mouth feel and absorb flavor even better! They get a 5 these get a 4.5 though!",4
A6BG3J3QYBS5B,Miracles do happen.: I find these noodles to be very good.  Make sure to follow the instructions and they will come out very good.  I like them in stir frys.  They do have a fishy scent when you open the package but after rinsing and a quick boil followed by a quick pan fry the scent is no existent.  They really have no flavor on there own but they really take on the flavor of the dish.  The best part is you get the textreme of pasta without all the carbs.,5
A3VSJO2KYV2ZGE,"Nope,  it's not pasta.  But ...: Look.  I have to be brutally honest here - I'm not going to lie to you.  This stuff is not going to win Flavor Of The Year,  nor will it win Texture Of The Year and unless you know what you're doing (at least a little bit)  you're probably going to end up with a mouth full of gummy,  gelatinous ""stuff""  and you won't like it one bit.

BUT!

(aha - there's always one,  isn't there?)

Treat these little things with a bit of attention and you can add pasta-ish-well-it-could-be-maybe--if-I-close-my-eyes-and-breathe-through-my-mouth-ness texture/filler that when smothered with (for example)  carbonara,  actually becomes something you can enjoy with a decadent sauce (carbonara - I mean come on,  who doesn't like carbonara?!)  and it'll go a long way in fooling yourself that you've just eaten something very naughty.

Many of us who have to watch our carbs basically get stuck with three options for pasta:

1.  Spaghetti squash  (passable,  but it's always going to have a hint of sweetness that can get in the way of flavor and texture)
2.  Zoodles  (see above)
3.  Suck it up and just not have any,  or pay too much for specialty pasta which is not actually that much better for you in terms of the glycemic index.

While it's never going to fool Julia Childs or Andrew Zimmern,  this is actually more-than-reasonable option.  At least give it a shot - you never know.

ADSID5I0TG49A,Stay away from this substance-less water bag.: This is by far the weirdest condition of a product I have ever ordered. I received the six pack as ordered and in a timely manner.

In those bags was 80% water and a cloud of something the could be described as looking like a bag of sea monkeys. I was absolutely grossed out by this and am debating throwing the whole package in the trash. If a company can't quality control the quantity of contents....

A3TTQ6FJWHYFWD,"Rinse with cool water. Shake well: In a word, GROSS.  I bought a 6-pack.  Big mistake.  Opened one.  These are NOT ziti for starters.  They are 12"" long tubes.  They are slimy and rubbery.  And they stink.  Washing helps, but it lingers.  Nasoya makes Pasta Zero spaghetti.  Rinse with cool water.  Shake well.  Then let stand in hot water for about 2 minutes.  (Do not recommend microwaving although some do.)  Add heated sauce and grated Parmesan.  Outstanding for minimal calories and low carbs.

A16DCOTN3OD46J,"Enjoying pasta again after reducing my carb intake: I really enjoy these noodles.  I bought them as a pasta replacement, which is an item I've mostly removed from my diet but had been missing.  I tried making pasta from strips of zucchini and carrot, which was a suggestion I'd seen, but either I did it wrong or people have different expectations than I do for pasta.

Let's talk about what you're getting:

*  Zero carbs, so they fit a lot of different low carb/no carb diets, or situations where you have no macros left at the end of the day.
*  Very, very low calories compared to most other pastas.
*  Neutral taste that easily absorbs flavors.
*  Consistency that necessitates a lot more chewing than regular pasta, making you eat more slowly.
*  I personally felt like I was fuller for much longer than I would've been after eating a regular pasta, but everyone's different.  Your mileage may vary.

As a pasta replacement for those who are dieting to lose weight or maintain a lower weight, these are a good substitute.  Are they exactly like flour pasta?  Nope.  Are you ever going to mistake this for regular pasta?  Nope.  However, they do provide you an excellent healthy way to get some variety in the lower calorie and/or lower carb dishes you're making.

Additionally:  I didn't notice any particular odor at all when I opened mine, but I don't generally make a habit of smelling everything before I drain it/wash it.  I cut open two bags, dumped them into a strainer, and rinsed them without noticing any remarkable smells.",5

I don't know whether I have to try this again or give up. I used a commercial tomato sauce. What I do like about it is the fact that it satisfies the hunger - if you get them down. May be I need to try a different recipe. Not giving up yet but getting close - rubbery, slimy things",1

Let me start off by saying I have been doing the ketogenic diet VERRRRY STRICLTY for just 5 days and its hard but I actually like it. HOWEVER... the pasta :( I cant live without my pasta and ramen and noodle soup. These noodles just made my week. They have a very slight rubbery texture that isn't in regular noodles but it almost makes it better. It for sure is a small portion for the price but I can say that now I will be splurging on these. Make sure you dry out the noodles in a completely dry pan and NOT with oil. Add it to some bouillon or your broth of choice and its delicious. Almost feels like you're cheating!,5

ATVJDAA6JG50Q,"I cannot say enough good things about these: UPDATE:

My favorite Miracle Noodles, in order:
1. Angel Hair -  By far my favorite. Texture is very close to ramen. I absolutely love eating with an organic cheese powder that I buy here on Amazon. The cheese clings to the noodles perfectly, and if I want to eat a childhood favorite, I ate a sliced organic hotdog. It's delicious!
2. Rice - This rice has amazing texture, and is perfect for adding to stews or stir fries. It absorbs flavor well. It's light and fluffy.
3. Fettuccine - I don't buy the fettuccine frequently, because I prefer the angel hair and rice so much more.
& lastly, the elbows. I don't recommend them. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the texture of Konnyaku flour doesn't work well as an elbow noodle. It ends up being too rubbery.

I cannot say enough good things about these. Okay - here's a secret about me. I'm a very healthy eater. Now and then I'll splurge with a snack or two, but for the most part, I eat a healthy, grain-free paleo diet.... but my secret is that I used to LOVE ramen noodles. Everything about them - the texture, the salty, MSG-laden taste of the packet that comes with them, especially the shrimp flavor! As I became more health conscious and kicked ramen noodles to the curb, I found myself yearning for the days when I would drop a convenient block of noodles in a boiling pot of water. Miracle noodles are just as convenient. Seriously. You rinse them in cool water, boil them for 2-3 minutes, drain them and you're done. Some of the instructions recommend dry roasting them in a pan for a minute afterwards. I haven't tried that yet, but I plan to. Regardless, they taste delicious.

I have been eating gluten-free for several years now. I missed the taste of real noodles. Rice noodles can be so sticky and heavy. Quinoa noodles are probably my second favorite, but they still don't satisfy my noodle craving the way Miracle Noodles do.

Miracle noodles are light but fulfilling. The texture is difficult to describe. It's similar to ramen, but if you're expecting it to be completely the same, you might disappointed. As far as taste goes, they are very mild-tasting, which means that they're perfect for adding spices to and creating whatever dish you dream of. I've been adding a small amount of broth to mine with spices like paprika, salt, garlic, and sometimes turmeric. I'll throw some peas in there or any other veggies I have on hand. It makes for such a quick, healthy meal.

I'm working on coming up with other sauce ideas. These won't work with the average tomato sauce because they require a stickier, thicker sauce since they don't absorb as well as a regular noodle does. The more I cook with these, however, the more I become accommodated with which flavors and toppings pair well with them. They're very unique, but they're worth experimenting with!

Update: I've found the perfect recipe for these! I eat paleo, so I'll give you the paleo version and the regular version of the recipe for you to try. First, I make a vegetable soup. I make mine from scratch using any veggies I have on hand, a pot roast, a can or two of crushed tomatoes, some vegetable stock, and a dash of honey. You can use a pre-made vegetable soup, or you can make your own with whichever ingredients you choose.

I divide it up so that half of it remains soup, and the other half will be used for my sauce for miracle noodles. I freeze them in separate containers (individual sized for convenience).

I use about 1/4 cup of the soup, toss it into a pan with 1 tablespoon or so of butter, add Coconut Aminos to taste, along with about 2 teaspoons of arrowroot. The arrowroot thickens the sauce to the PERFECT texture so that the miracle noodles absorb the sauce. It tastes absolutely amazing - almost like a beef stroganoff. I season it with a bit of sea salt and paprika. It's so savory and delicious. If you don't eat paleo and you don't have these ingredients on hand, no problem. Take your soup, add butter and some soy sauce to taste along with enough flour to thicken it to your liking. You can use any thickener you choose. Either way, it'll taste amazing. I mix it with the miracle noodles, it blends so well, and it's the perfect portion of food for me.

My 2nd favorite recipe:
1 package Miracle Noodles Angel Hair
Organic Cheese Powder
Butter
Protein of your choice (cooked hamburger meat, hot dogs, chicken, etc.)

Rinse and cook your Miracle Noodles. Add about 1/2 tablespoon of butter - basically you want to coat the noodles with some liquid leftover on the bottom. Then, add in as much cheese powder as preferred. I like mine mildly cheesy, but if I'm in the mood to add extra, I sometimes also add more butter to ensure that it ends up creamy. The cheese powder sticks so well to these noodles.

Afterwards, toss in some cooked hamburger, hot dogs, chicken, or any meat of your choice. Or eat it plain..tastes delicious by itself!

As far as nutritional value - they are touted as a weight loss food. I don't eat them for that reason though. Sure, they're low-calorie, but I eat them because they're also nearly carbohydrate free. I avoid carbs because I'm a mild diabetic, and I avoid grains due to GI problems. These are the perfect option for me. They also slow the digestive process which makes for better digestion and absorption of nutrients.

I honestly recommend these to everyone I meet - whether you follow a strict, healthy diet or you just want to experiment with a new pasta, these are a wonderful alternative. And the price is fantastic as well.",5

AE0BM99KXYOJJ,"You MUST try these!: Love these!  A must try!  Cannot understand why some buyers complain...the ""odor"" disappears with rinsing.  I experienced no ""squeaky"" sound upon chewing as some reviewers suggested.  I prepared them pretty much according to package directions - boil then saute - and the texture was fine.  No complaints!  I tried them with tomato, basil and a little marinara - very good!  These are a great find and I highly recommend them to anyone needing to cut calories or carbs.

Upon opening the bag, they smell like fish. Straight up. Fish water. Do NOT cook it how it says on the package. After straining out the water, heat up some butter or olive oil in a pan and fry it with pepper/garlic powder. This is the only way I've found that will rid it of the fishy smell. After cooking them like so, you can add your sauce/meat & overall, the taste is great after that. But i find that I get EXTREMELY full, off of only half a serving. Full in a bad way. I am sensitive to certain foods and this just happens to be one of them. But it was definitely worth trying. By all means. My favorite is the angel hair.",3

A1TZLZKC9UID1J,"Great calorie free alternative to glass noodles :): Yes, these noodles are in a highly potent liquid, but draining and completely rinsing the noodles gets rid of the smell. Their texture isn't like Italian pasta, but more like glass noodles or ramen, so to compare them to ""normal"" pasta isn't fair. They don't have a flavor, so just taste like whatever sauce you use. My preparation includes first draining the noodles from the package, then rinsing them until they've been completely dissolved from any odor. Then I prepare whatever sauce I'm making on the stove, and right before the sauce is done I microwave the noodles for 1 min and then put the sauce on top :). Great alternative to low calorie noodles :) I just wish they were less than $2 a bag.",5

A17O9AHKHK66AI,"Household Staple: This works very much like rice if you prepare it correctly. You have to rinse it thoroughly, then boil it for three minutes, and then scoot it around on a dry hot pan to get a good bit of the moisture out - you don't want it to shrink, just dry it out a little. If you don't do that, or if you do it in the wrong order (like I did - for years), the texture will be wrong. It's about 10 minutes of prep, but it's easy and worth it.

Best as a replacement for rice in saucy dishes. Not something you want to just eat plain (I don't anyway).",4

AV1T5TWN9UQ3T,"The best ""noodles"" I've had yet!: I bought these on a different account last year, but finally tried them out last night for dinner and I'm glad I did! These are freaking delicious. I read a couple of other reviews at the time and noticed a LOT of people were put off by the fishy smell. When I first opened the package, it DID have the pungent fish smell (reminded me of raw squid rings) but I was determined to make a healthy, delicious dinner with those noodles. As instructed, I rinsed the noodles in cold water for 15 seconds (actually went a bit longer just to make sure the smell rinsed off), boiled them for 2 minutes, then placed them in an non-greased/oiled pan and dried them that way.

After they were dry, I added in leftover lean beef (93/7), artichoke hearts, spinach, and a tablespoon of Asian spicy garlic sauce and OH MY GOD, it was amazing! Honestly, the noodles capture the flavor of whatever sauce you're using, so you don't have to worry about it tasting like raw, stinky fish. I don't see why other people aren't in love with this product. If you don't like it, just send it to me! I have yet to try the rice version, but I am more than excited to see what other dishes I can come up with. I try to limit my carb intake several days throughout the week and these let me feel like I'm eating spaghetti again! I will definitely be buying these again, thanks so much!",5

A33YBCIVMJRN1N,Three Stars: Ok ok.. No real taste.. Depends upon your cooking skill,3
A15J4T062BHY0E,"Not a ""quick meal"", but worth it.: I was a bit skeptical of this because I never really cared much for the miracle noodles, but I figured I'd try the rice just to see how I liked it. If you bite into this expecting RICE you're going to quirk a brow. It's a bit plumper than a grain of rice and I've found the best way to eat it, after rinsing it in a colander to wash away the bit of smell that comes from the water it's packed in, is to throw it right into a frying pan.

I scramble some eggs and cook up a bit of meat in a pan, then throw the rice right on top of the eggs/meat. (Let it cook for a little bit, you'll see lots of steam because it's quite moist) After a few minutes on high heat I toss in a little butter and soy sauce, plus whatever veggies I feel like that day. The end result is a low calorie (if you don't overuse the butter) and very low carb fried rice dish.

I have made this ""rice"" a regular staple and eat it about three times a week now. It keeps me full as it's a slow digested fiber, and as I no longer eat regular rice, I don't really notice much texture difference anymore. I'm sure I would if I was to eat the two next to each other, but to me, this is just what ""rice"" is.

I don't think it would be good with just butter salt and pepper though, which is how I used to eat my rice. This stuff actually needs to be in a recipe rather than a quick bite, I feel.

I am going to try to do a cheesy broccoli rice next and see how that comes out.",5

I thought I would like the tofu noodles better than these but  don't like the tofu noodles at all. My advice would be learn about them first. There are several good videos on Youtube about preparing miracle noodles. 1. I rinse them well 2. put them in a hot frying pan alone first 3. then after a minute or two I add ghee minced garlic and sometimes a bit of minced onion. Some people put them in boiling water with salt. 4. I then mix them with a high fat cheese sauce. Pasta has always been one of my favorite foods but I don't want the carbs anymore. Miracle noodle has been a lifesaver for me.,5
ASF63S2Z62PMD,"I love these!: I LOVE these.  My kids & husband don't.. Their loss!  If you've had a multitude of noodle varieties, you'll appreciate this low calorie/carb option.  If you are into your normal store bought pasta, and aren't into a variation noodle, move along!",5
A2ZLEUHV2W8X69,"Prepare it right!: Okay so I found out about these noodles a few days ago. I'm currently on a weight loss journey. I have lost 50 lbs but I have another 100+ to go. I am also Italian and therefore LOVE my pasta. I really miss eating it. So I ordered some on here but, not wanting to wait to try them, went out and found them at my local Meijer so I could try them.
First of all, there is definitely a texture difference. If you don't take the time to prepare these the right way you will most likely trigger your gag reflex and throw them out. I made the mistake of not boiling and drying all the brine out the first time. Also, I don't recommend these with alfredo sauce. I nearly threw up. But since I bought two packages I thought I'd give it another go with spaghetti sauce. Here's what I did.
1) drain noodles in colander under cold water for a minute or more.
2) boil water. I added olive oil and Italian seasonings to the water in the hopes the noodles took on their flavor instead of the brine taste.
3) boil the noodles for 2 1/2 minutes
4) drain and rinse again
5) line a plate with paper towels. Place noodles on plate. Microwave for one minute
6) heat up noodles in frying pan for a minute or two. Add sauce. Heat sauce to boiling and mix with noodles.
Voila! A bit time consuming but the end result was worth it. No fishy flavor and I barely noticed the texture difference. I had a spaghetti dinner that was only 105 calories. You can't beat that!
All in all I'm glad I gave this another chance. This will really open up my diet menu. I'm excited to try more recipes and try the rice version!",5

A3GXIK8DHVF5LM,"Dieters review: I have been on a very restricted diet for 6 months now.  I was looking for products I could have and stumbled upon miricle noodles.
The key is how you cook them.  Making sure you rinse the noodles in hot water for 5 min minimum until the fishy smell is gone is very important.  Next put them into a hot frying pan this changes the texture cook them for quite a while and they will start to dry out.  At this point they really have no flavor so add spices or sauces.  I enjoy soy sauce makes a nice addition to a stir fry.

Pros- no carbs sugar and so on
  Easy to prepare about the same amount of time as boiling and cooking.
Picks up flavor from spices
Cons -
Horrible smell of fish until rinsed
Texture could be off putting to some

-Commodity, amazon, direct to my door

Cons
-Smell, compared to the Nasoya brand, these smell like fish when opened
-Texture & Flavour, again, compared to Nasoya, these had not color, flavour or texture. They were also very difficult to imprint with whatever they were mixed with
-Water, they release a ton of water, even after heating them on a pan for several minutes. Making whatever you mix them into a soup!

Luckily I can get the Nasoya noodles at my local supermarket, and they taste much better. They also have a much yellower color, and mix much better with whatever you're cooking them with.

They arrived yesterday and so I made a nice sauce with homegrown tomatoes, garlic, onions, avocado oil, herbs de Provence, sea salt and freshly grated parmesan.  I opened two packs of the fettuccine noodles and they did smell fishy and slightly like ammonia as others have noted.  I rinsed them in cold water and then blanched and dried them as directed.  They still smelled, but not as much.  I read that they absorb the taste of the sauce, so I mixed them into the sauce rather than put it on top.  Then I tried it.  First impression was the very unpleasant texture, which I would describe as somewhere between gelatin and raw jellyfish.  The smell and taste of the noodles remains, but is mostly masked by the sauce.  I couldn't eat the noodles.  One pack of noodles serves one person.  So you get 6 servings of noodles / rice, which seems quite expensive to me.  Especially when it tastes so awful.  I threw out the cooked noodles from last night and I'm tossing the other 4 packs unopened.  Yuk.",1

AZAA9LNPL83YF,"it's a miracle we found these miracle noodles: my fiance and i are obsessed. i'm not sure why everyone thinks the texture is so nasty. if you've had asian rice noodles, these have a similar texture, slightly chewy. ive found that if you cook them longer they are less rubbery. they're tasteless so you need a good sauce to eat these with. i've been making a sort of asian style sauce for these and the dish comes out amazing. i've noticed that these noodles don't do so well with watery sauces, they need some sort of thick sauce to coat them. i haven't even made zoodles in a couple weeks because we like these noodles even better. these are so easy to use...rinse them off (they do smell a little fishy immediately out of the bag) with cold water for 10 seconds, then i throw them into a saute pan and sauce them and cook for like 10 mins on medium heat. my favorites are the fettucine and angel hair. the rice is a little annoying to rinse bc it falls through the holes in my colander. overall these are amazing noodle substitutes...zero calorie, zero glycemic index, zero carb.",5
A24WGDCSJFP8UK,"TERRIBLE!!: I am low carbing, and I miss rice terribly. I decided to buy these as rice substitutes. I had the noodles before and I made them into a chicken stir-fry. The taste wasn't like regular chow-mein, but it was a great substitute for what I was craving. I thought for some reason, this would work out the same as the noodles. It turned out to be TERRIBLE!!! It does NOT taste anything like rice. It does not have the texture of rice. It does not look like rice. It is just all together a terrible replacement for rice... When I opened the bag, the smell of fish came flying out and slapped me like a raw fish. I followed the rules, soaked it in water, just like I followed them for the noodles I bought before. These are terrible because they not only smell like fish, they taste like fish. I would not buy the rice one again. As a matter of fact, after I tasted one bag, I threw the rest away. I bought like 12 of them. Waste of money. I hope I help anyone who is considering buying these.",1

AI1HLDSBL6Q0F,I especially like the rice shaped ones: I grew up eating konnyaku in Japan. Now that Im on a low calorie diet I was thrilled to see these on Amazon. I especially like the rice shaped ones. I don't think they are a good rice substitute since the texture is so different from real rice. But I love mixing these with ground meat as a filler to reduce the calories per serving. I make chicken patties and even spaghetti meat sauce with them.  When mixed with ground meat you don't really notice the extra chewy consistency. I bet it will be good in hamburgers too. I also use them in more traditionally Japanese noni dishes with the block shaped konnyaku. Great in nabe too. I added some in my asian style stuffed cabbage rolls as well. They have no taste so they go well with anything!,5

A1JE7PUM5I3R5F,"Carb free, what more could you want??: I used to love Italian food but I have to say I haven't had it in years. It never went well with my stomach and then I was diagnosed gluten intolerant. I always missed pasta and how easy it is to make and how filling it is but I definitely never missed the carbs or upset belly. I heard about this online and saw it for the first time at Whole Foods when I visited my mom though the brand was different. I loved how it was filling and easy, though it definitely doesn't taste anything like regular pasta. Since I don't have a Whole Foods around, I ordered these off line and they taste exactly the same as the other brand though are more translucent in color. Since I'm not used to normal pasta, I can't complain, though I will say my friends think its bland and gross in texture. The texture is weird..really rubbery but most Asian noodles are anyway. The taste is bland but not bad, the good thing with these noodles though is that they soak up whatever sauce you put on them extremely well. I make avocado garlic hummus and I mix that in with the noodles along with Parmesan cheese, marinara sauce. I bring it to school/work with me and I only taste the sauce, not the noodles so it tastes pretty good. However, if I eat it right away it doesn't taste as good. I heard cooking it on a skillet with sauce will allow the flavor to penetrate more into the noodles so they taste more like pasta though. If you bring these to work and won't eat them for a few hours, be aware not to use a lot of spices/garlic sauce or it will be an overkill. Also, when you first open the noodle package, it does smell like fish, I think its a natural preservative type thing. I put the noodles in a drainer and run water over them for 5 minutes and the smell goes away.",5

Second time, I fried them up with an egg and some velveeta. They looked just like really good grits,

A37YE441QUO8WK,"Different texture, didn't work for me, but were good when I cooked them a different way. :): I preface my review with the knowledge that I have been GF for 5+ years and have been moderately low carb on and off for about 8 years. I seriously miss things like a blue box of mac n' cheese, fresh cinnamon rolls, and pizza or chinese food delivered to my house. I have had to eat healthy for so long that it's all the quick serve and takeout I miss because it's usually all forbidden. I keep hoping one day there will either be a miraculous cure for the whole celiac gluten issue and that someone will find more low carb options. I was totally up for trying these interesting noodles. I can't speak for everyone who is GF, but I know there are some odd products I have put myself through sampling in search of satisfying food.

Now to the noodles....
First note, yes, the noodles smell lightly fishy. The smell I associate with the packaged fake crab meat made from fish. As a lover of seafoods this didn't bother me, but if you don't like it when someone in the office is warming up a seafood dish at lunch, this might not be for you. Those who do not like sushi, or fish, or seafood in general (you know who you are) please keep in mind before purchase. You rinse them enough and the smell does mostly go away.
I tried the fettuccini first and followed all directions of prep. I then added tuna and cheese for essentially a box meal tuna helper type experience.
I rate the noodles as OK. The texture is a little off for me... a little slippery and a tiny bit rubbery. I also made some of the rice, just adding cheese and seasoning. Again, odd textured. So when I was going to eat the leftovers I decided to see how well they would be if baked into a crisp. I just poured the cheesy rice I had made onto a baking sheet (with nonstick spray) and put in the oven at 375. They took a while to get crispy, but tasted good and that texture issue was now gone. Crispy and cheesy, worked for me. It will be how I finish the rest of the packages. I can't say I would purchase again to use as the directions recommend, but I might order more if I want to make more crispy things with no carbs in the future.",4

A1LNUBK8OQCGAE,"Excellent non-starch noodle alternative - especially if you enjoy a slightly chewy noodle: These are nearly calorie-free, starch free noodles that you can use in recipes if you are trying to reduce the amount of starches you are taking in, but love the texture of noodles.  They are mostly just the soluble fiber from a plant.  There are some things you need to know about these. They are shipped in liquid, so there is a heavy shipping fee due to weight.  When you open each package you then drain the liquid out, rinse off the packing liquid, and prepare the noodles.  If you prepare the noodles using the instructions on the box, you will boil them for a couple of minutes, then fry or saut&eacute; them briefly.  Then you would place them into other recipes.  The noodles by themselves have very little taste and a chewy texture.  They are very reminiscent of clear angel hair rice noodles, but slightly more chewy.  I happen to like that chewy texture so much that I just rinse the noodles off and throw them into soups or my steamer with veggies, or boil them for 2 minutes and them throw them into some sauce or another recipe.  If you want them less chewy, you can boil them longer.  You can also fry off the extra moisture to improve the texture for some things.

These make a very nice noodle or spaghetti replacement that is not difficult to prepare, if you want an alternative to spiral cutting spaghetti squash or other such tricks.",5

If you do a decent job rinsing them (more than what they say on the packet), and then boil them for the required time, the smell goes away. You will not taste it on the noodles. I often flavor mine with soy sauce like stir fry; they do tend to be a little gummy and tend to lack flavor, but by flavoring them and using a pan, it can be fixed.

A2FXC6N9S9HBSG,"Shirataki noodles are the perfect substitute for pasta: I have to laugh at all the negative reviews on shirataki noodles.  It takes a change of mind and heart to appreciate these noodles.  I have been following a wheat and grain free lifestyle.  Shirataki noodles are the perfect substitute for pasta, but they, in no way, taste like pasta.  They keep me full without a bloated feeling and yes, they take a lot of seasoning. The noodles are going to be as tasty as your sauces.  There are no calories or carbs so I'm a lifetime advocate.  My husband is a negative naysayer on food changes,  so he gets regular wheat flour spaghetti while I use my shirataki noodles.  I prefer the rice shirataki and the fettuccini shirataki.  Larger pieces of shirataki are more rubbery so I stick with the smaller varieties.  The package claims that it absorbs the taste of the sauce.  I haven't found this to be true. Regular pasta will
absorb liquids and it will break down when reheated, swell up if left in the pan, or stick together when
refrigerated. As the root of a plant, shirataki noodles remain intact without soaking up all the sauce or juices. It is more of a filler which makes your sauces go further.  If the product is rinsed and drained properly the fishy smell is gone and it won't water down your sauce.  So, it depends how badly you want to change your eating habits, possibly lose some weight, and get back to a healthier lifestyle.  I'm on board with shirataki noodles.",5

The taste does not compare to pasta, but it's much better than i thought. And for having no calories or carbs it is well worth it.

-Texture is a bit more rubbery than pasta.
-Drain it and let it soak in water for a few minutes before cooking to get rid of the smell.

Well, it turns out, nothing but the price. As another reviewer pointed out, the packets are small and only sufficient for a single meal for one person - quite expensive indeed compared to the price of regular pasta or even gluten-free pasta, which always tends to cost more. But that was the only detraction. I made it following the instructions (easy and very quick aside from boiling the water) and the texture and taste were fantastic! I did cut it up after making it since other reviewers pointed out the noodles are long, but one has to do the same thing with regular or gluten free spaghetti. One thing: I tend to like seafood (fish, shrimp, scallops) and this struck me as a somewhat seafood-like product. I did make it with whiting (fish), some chopped zucchini, some spinach, and some salt and olive oil, and that may have contributed to this impression... and overall it was delicious and satisfying.",5

When the package is opened, there is a distinctively fishy smell, but don't worry because it washes away.  I put the noodles in the colander and rinse them with cold water, thoroughly, until the aroma is gone.  Then, I blanch the noodles in boiling water for a couple of minutes, before taking them out to drain & dry on a paper towel.

If these were less expensive I'd buy and use them on the regular. As it is they are good but you don't get enough for the price you pay. On top of that the process you have to go through in order to cook them is time consuming. You have to wash them and then cook them in a certain way in order for them to have any taste.",3
A134HFABW6BMZL,"I think they're delicious!: I wonder if some of the folks who left negative reviews didn't realize that you MUST RINSE AND STRAIN these noodles.  For that matter, rinse and strain them a second time!  Once you do, however, you'll have a perfectly good noodle substitute with no fishy aftertaste.  They do have a slightly different consistency than wheat noodles, but it's not hard to get used to.

I'm gluten intolerant (I get major acid reflux within minutes of eating any wheat product), so it's nice to have a gluten free alternative.  We've also been trying to eat lower carb to loose weight, so these are perfect for our family.

While you can use these for a spaghetti style Italian dish, I think they are best suited for Asian recipes.  Think of them more as a replacement for rice noodles than a replacement for wheat noodles and you're sure to be happy.  The simplest way to enjoy them is to simply boil them as instructed (rinse first!) and then toss with toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, lime juice, maybe some cilantro.  Yum!  They would probably make a great pad thai, though I haven't tried it with these yet.",5
A2EXR4ISJHTK43,"Can't stand the texture of this pasta: I have seen where people mentioned a ""fishy"" smell. I agree. The water they are packaged in smells rancid. I also saw people mention it was kind of like an ""al dente pasta"". I totally disagree. It made me feel like what I would expect squid tentacles to feel like in my mouth. They were very rubbery, gelatinous, slimy feeling. I cooked the angel hair pasta like the instructions on the bag stated. My daughter ate some of them, then said she felt like throwing up later that night. That could be because of all of the fiber making her feel too full. I tried to just swallow a few noodles because every time I tried to bite into them or chew them, I wanted to gag at the texture. If you have a problem with certain textures of foods, stay away from this. As for taste, there really isn't much of one.

AYRFQOPEMY3RN,"Liked it after a number of experiments...: So this was my first time trying this product and it definitely took some experimentation before I personally found it edible.  I'll try to explain the different ways I tried to prepare it below:

***Opening the box:  First glance I thought ""Eww...lol"".  They're very clear/transparent.  Using a scissor, I opened the bag and prepared myself for an awful fish smell like I've read in other reviews but honestly, it's not that bad.  It's very mild in my opinion, but I guess it depends on your tolerance for fish odor.  A few minutes of rinsing helped to reduce the smell.

1. First I followed the instructions on the packet [rinse, boil then cook].  HATED it [lol].  It was still kind of chewy in my opinion.  I mean, I'm open to trying new things, but this way of preparing it had me gagging on it so I threw out this batch.
2. Since I didn't like it in it's wet form, I tried frying it.  After rinsing [to remove that slight fishy smell], I shook off the noodles and placed them on paper towel to dry off a bit.  After that I threw them in a hot frying pan [with about half a teaspoon of oil] and let them fry for about 10 minutes with dried them out a bit.  After that, in a separate pan, I stir fried some chicken breast, some broccoli and other chopped veggies with some oyster sauce, placed that on a plate and put the noodles on the side and gave it a try.  It wasn't that bad at all!  Though I will give a warning [the longer you fry the noodles in a pan, the more water comes out causing it to reduce DRAMATICALLY!  The majority of this product is WATER.

If you still aren't sure, I say you should try to see if you can just buy 1 packet and try it out.  Hope this helps someone :)",3

A3JU4RW6OGL605,"Not substitutes for noodles if you like tasty food: I like rice noodles, glass noodles, I enjoy oddly textured foods. We eat a variety of weird foods.
These noodles are horrid if you consider taste or texture.
If you are one of those folks who think artificial sweeteners taste like sugar then these noodles might work for you.
If you eat fat free cheese and do not think it tastes bad then these noodles might work for you.
If you think gluten free bread tastes just like real bread then these are your noodles.
If you only eat because food provides nutrition or bulk then please try these for the bulk.
For those who like to taste food or want to be able to enjoy eating this is not the food item for you.
No way is this a workable or useful substitution for pasta.
The texture is like the inside of a cheap jelly bean.
Tried all the ""tricks"" in several recipes --  rinsed, heated to dry, let rest overnight to absorb flavor, baked in a dish.
Three packs later - this is not a food substance it is something that looks like food.

I'm sure many of you will do the same thing I did.... look at the item, read the reviews and either put them on your wish list to think about later or just think... are they worth the money to find out if they are as bad-or good-as the reviews say?  I was still contemplating this question when my husband snuck into my account and bought them. Surprise!  They arrived today--so of course I had to try them today!

They stink... oh man do they stink.  Something died kind of stink.  I rinsed them... they stank less.  I boiled them... the didn't stink at all.... I put them in a teflon pan (no oil per directions) and dried them out.  Still no stink.  Ok.... I tasted a piece.  They taste like... NOTHING.  Seriously... there is no taste.  They have an odd texture... kind of rubbery, but not real rubbery.  But there is no taste.  What to do now?  So I was fixing pan fried pork chops in butter for dinner... we have a pan with all those good scrapings, butter and grease.... and yes, we dumped these noodles in and sort of flash fried them in all that yummy goodness.  And they tasted... just like what we fried them in.  Pretty darn good.

Do they taste like real noodles. No they don't.  From what we tried tonight, they do taste like whatever your cook them in.  I'll have to try boiling them in stock next time.  Do they have the same texture? Nope, they have a very distinctive texture and I have no idea how to really describe it.  But you know what, when you aren't eating real noodles--for whatever reason--these fill that craving.  They aren't the same, but they are close enough.

I didn't expect to like these, I really didn't, but I really do.  Try them.... don't let the negative reviews scare you off... they really are good!",4

I would open it up, look at them and promptly grab something else more appetizing and less healthy. Not being one to waste money, one day I decided I was going to try them.  I was determined to give it a fair go. The initial smell was fishy, but after rinsing and cooking it, it went away.

I've seen reviews saying it smells like fish, it smells different when you open the bag but if you FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. It says to rinse for a minute before cooking to wash packaging solution off.

I love these noodles!! I use in my shrimp scampi, Pad Thai, etc to keep the carb count down!",5
AQ3IN3MRXQ5KH,"Great Stuff!: I find this pasta substitute to be a terrific replacement for wheat or rice noodles in most of my Asian dishes and have used it successfully in my wok stir-fry as well as in soups.  I open the package and immediately throw the contents into a small colander and RINSE for a few seconds under running water.  A couple of quick shakes and then into a pan or pot it goes.

Use it the same as you would vermicelli or Asian ""rice sticks"" -- I use the fettuccine style for chow fun or chow mein and the vermicelli style for pansit, udon, or soups.  It's no quite the same but for a no carb/no calorie substitute it's close to perfect.

This is the same stuff as konjac, konjak, konjaku, konnyaku.  Also known in the plant world as Amorphophallus konjac.  If you watch late night or early morning TV, you might see commercials for a ""miracle capsule"" for weight loss where it's been ""clinically proven to help you lose fat -- not just water weight but actual fat"".  Read the top right corner of the box when it flashes by on the screen -- yup, Amorphophallus konjac.  Same stuff!  So instead of spending $$$ for a box of pills you can just eat it with your meal.

My recommendation is that if you're on a low calorie/low carbohydrate diet and happen to love noodles then give this a try.  You can find konjac in some supermarkets or Asian grocery stores and if you like it then by the box-full like I do here on Amazon.",5

A1F002ABWJAQMF,"Not your average noodle!: For those of you struggling along on a low calorie diet, this may be a godsend. If you've tried spaghetti squash and thought 'meh,' then you may like this better. I know I do.

Normal spaghetti noodles are soft and there isn't much resistance when you bite down on one You are probably familiar with those.

Spaghetti squash 'noodles' have a undeniable crunch to them and a very slight tarty taste.

Miracle Noodles, shirataki noodles, are soft and have a slight gelatinous squish to them when you bite down. They are fairly transparent and the flavor is non-existent.

I eat Miracle Noodles all the time with a healthy all natural spaghetti sauce, sometimes adding ground lean turkey or bison. I have not missed normal spaghetti in the year since I discovered these. I love pasta so this is great for me. Of course, these offer no real nutritional value themselves, so you need to keep up with the spinach salad beforehand, but it's a great alternative to high calorie/low nutrition wheat noodles.

The noodles are composed of soluble fiber which have not posed any additional issues for me, despite my ongoing unresolved digestive problems.

My son coached me to empty the package into a strainer and wash the noodles. The don't have a great smell when they come out of the packaging, and washing them takes care of most of it.

I've also mixed it up with salmon and skim cream cheese, soy sauce, eggs, etc. Just plan on adding an element of flavor and you won't be disappointed. Especially at 0 calories!!!!",5
AZR7LUR3RRVKQ,"Not konjac but agar: Ugh.  I am so disappointed.  I have used konjac noodles (Miracle noodles) for years on and off and thought these were just a dried version.  Wrong.  These are made from agar not konjac.  Unlike konjac, agar is destructive to the human gut just like carrageenan .  I'm working hard to heal my gut I don't want to do more damage.  These do taste better but the cost of that is far too high.  I will stick with the original.",1

ANKTDODLVQCCQ,Best gluten free noodles I've had!: I love these noodles! I have a severe allergy to corn & celiacs disease so I've always struggled to find noodles I can have that taste good. These were perfect for stir fry & it was the first time in four years I've had lomein & it tastes just like the old gluten filled kind I've been missing! The smell at first isn't pleasant but it's gone after a quick rinse. I ordered them at first from Thrive Market but was so excited to find them available on Amazon for the same price & eligible for prime shipping. We will be ordering again soon.. probably in only a few days at the rate we eat these!,5
A2YE68I0YS6W1A,Five Stars: Love these as a healthy pasts replacement,5
A15IJ72WCCIZ8H,Stick with the noodles: I think I will stick with the noodles.  The rice have kind of a chewy texture that I'm not very fond of.  They taste the same as the noodles. I would not say these are a good replacement for rice.,2

AXKSHS2Q2FG4P,"You should definitely try these!: I purchased this small variety pack last week. They arrived this week as expected. 2 of each came in the box. For a decent size meal for one, I used both of each pack at a time. The people on here that state they smell must have super senses because I did not smell the ""order"" they speak of. Then again, I anticipated one, so I immediately emptied the back out in a strainer under running water. As they tell you on the actual site, you should rinse them first for 30 to 60 seconds. I did it a little longer. They also say let them drain a bit and then lightly boil them for no more than 3 minutes. I failed to do this part but it didn't seem to matter. Once I had rinsed them, I emptied them onto a towel and patted them to get some more of the water off. Also, I should mention, the noodles are long, so you may consider cutting them while they are still in the strainer. Next I added them to a wok and let them simmer for a bit. To get even more of the water out, because they will still have some in there. You want to make sure most if not all the water is out before you turn up the heat (slightly) to finish the dish. I added my other ingredients (garlic, spices, etc) after about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir fry that. I also use Braggs Liquid Amino (no calaries and no added salt and gives them a great taste) Added other veggies and protein when they were almost done. Best noodles ever! And no calories? Today I went to their web page and ordered a bigger variety pack (on auto delivery too) and can't wait to get them. I'm currently on a VLCD and enjoy the filler. I will never eat other pasta at home again. I feel like the people who say these were not good...um, probably aren't good cooks. If you know how to cook good food using spices and good proteins this will be the best pasta dish you made.",5

A2882YAS4TFVEQ,"Fantastic noodles!: I'm eating a bowl of these as I write this review; I just couldn't wait to talk about them!

I ordered these (after seeing them on Cooking With Dog) in the hopes that I could increase my fiber intake, and the zero calorie thing came as an added bonus. I was really nervous to make these because of some of the negative reviews, but I genuinely feel that those particular reviewers were either 1) expecting something that tasted exactly like pasta, or 2) did not prepare these correctly. Prep is absolutely essential.

First off, the fishy smell reminds me of a fresh fish market, and was not at all unpleasant. That smell (as others have said) does not carry over into the flavor. You need to rinse these for about 4-5 minutes in cold water until the smell goes away, and then drop them into a pot of boiling water for 5-6 minutes. Strain them, rinse again in cold water (to remove the rubbery texture they get when boiled) and finally dry saute them in a pan till you hear squeaking. It's a little time consuming, but nothing crazy.

I soaked the prepared noodles for a few hours in my favorite sauce (hoisin, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, and water to thin it out) and combined it with pan fried tofu. The texture of the noodles is perfect -not starchy or rubbery, but sort of lightly chewy yet still soft enough to bite through cleanly, as most asain noodles are- and they soaked up the sauce and taste absolutely fabulous!

It may be a bit pricey for everyday fare, but for a health conscious college student like me, it's enough to take the edge off of takeout cravings. Give these a shot!",5
A1819WWZR0G3V,"Pretty tasteless: Pretty tasteless, not really something I will ever use again. Instead, I recommend something healthy like a brown rice fettuccini noodle. Yes, you will have a few more calories, but they will be healthy ones and the taste is much, much better.",3
A2RB8LLATK4DUZ,"Good filler for dieting.: The consistency is good, it doesn't fall apart when you cook it.

I have to make a confession though, I have never smelled them uncooked or done any of the preparation. I know, I am a huge wimp. I have to admit, the reviews scared me off. I really thought that if I smelled even a hint of any fishy or chemical aroma that whether it was present in the final taste of the product or not, my mind would go there making them inedible. In comes my husband to the rescue with his amazing cooking skills. He has rinsed them and prepared them several times now. I wanted to wait to be sure when writing my review. I have had them in pho and sauted in a tomato basil sauce among other things. Every time, they simply take on the flavor of whatever it is they are cooked with. I do not find the texture unappealing either. It is very close to pasta - think ramen noodles. They are a bit more slippery, but not enough for my taste buds not to be fooled.

Tried this out in a stir fry and it is great, you do have to prep the noodles first, rinse in colander with cold water, nuke for two minutes, rinse again, nuke again, and you are all set to fly. I also cut these noodles with a pair of scissors since they are pretty long.

It doesn't really cook up like rice, more like those pearl balls they put in drinks, just a whole lot less tasty. If, however, you plan on eating this you better plan on drowning it is seasonings. I've cooked it to the precise directions on several occasions and find that it cooks up like ""Cartlidge"" there is no other way of describing it. I've added extra sea salt to the water, brought it to a higher boil and extended the boil times by an extra 30 seconds 6 times (total extra time 3 minutes so far) at the same time adding extra skillet time. Here is the part where you need to really pour or shake on your seasonings. If you think you like a little salt or seasoning you will end up eating bland slimy cartilage. So far my advice is to experiment with the boiling to soften it up to your preferred softness, I'm still trying to find that point for me. Then find the right amount of skillet time that will allow the seasonings to fully penetrate the noodle. That is where the really tough part is, getting the noodle fully seasoned enough so it tasty enough to eat. Not just tolerate.

-The delivery time was fast, incredibly so. I think I ordered these last Sunday, and received them yesterday. Like they said, the package faintly smells of fish. But, it doesn't linger. Besides, nothing wrong with fish. It is healthier ;P (note, this product did not come with fish...)
The boxes (I ordered this and a variety pack) came encased in larger box that had large air bubble security wrap (not bubble wrap). Neatly assorted as well.
You can immediately tell these people don't just take your money and that's all she wrote. They actually ensure that it was worth your buy.

- The preparation:
If you are unfamiliar with angel hair noodles, then you might be a it intimidated when you empty the contents into a strainer. It looks gucky and messy, perhaps not appetizing or edible.
But no worries! The preparation is rather simple, and if you read the back of each pack, you'll realize what I'm talking about. (I explain the process at the end of this post).

- The taste:
Like any noodle on its own, the taste isn't pleasant unless you add some taste. The extra condiments I use range from 0-2 calories. So all the while, a large serving of this rounds up to about 6-10 calories.
So be creative! But don't take advantage of it being low calorie, or you'll end up eating an unhealthy worth. It's like ordering a side of diet coke with that large movie theater popcorn. Don't go delusional!

Overall, I haven't had pasta or noodles in years because of my obsession with calorie counting and eating healthy. These hit the spot! I get full, don't feel hungry later, and if you do it right, they taste just like the real thing!

So yes! I'm definitely ordering more! Thank you Miracle Noodle!

This is how I boil/cook it (for those unfamiliar with any form of thin asian noodle or angel hair):
First pre-heat the stove top you'll be using with med-high.
Fill up a pot with water to the amount of noodles you'll be boiling (be it one, two or three packs - 4oz's, 6oz's, 8oz's) with some salt (optional) and let it sit until water is boiling. Lower temp to medium.
Simply empty packet[s] into a strainer, and let it drain. Don't forget to wash your hands and aid the straining process by stirring the noodles a bit.
Then just plop them into the pot, let them sit for around 2-4 minutes (or more, depending on how much you're cooking).
Stir them around a bit.
Turn off stove top, let the noodles absorb the water a bit, but don't allow them to be over-heated/cooked because you'll be applying more heat later.
Empty the pot into the strainer again, to get rid of the water.
Using a pan, or skillet pan, what have you.preferably non-stick, place it on the same stove top you used earlier on medium heat. then place the noodles onto the pan, and toss around a bit, till the moisture KIND OF goes away. You'll hear it sizzling.
But don't overdue it! Or the noodles will harden, and the taste won't be as nice.
Once they look less wet and pale white (note, they won't look dark or anything either. Just less 'unprepared') empty pan contents onto a plate.
Using a fork and a knife, start pulling apart noodles from the bulk onto other side, cutting the noodles. Not mince, just cut. That way, the noodles won't be super long, and easier to eat.

Then, wisely, mix it up. Remember, just cause it's zero calorie, doesn't mean it does you justice to suddenly make it into a 500 calorie meal.",5
AOO6FNB1OLKAF,My favorite!: I love these! Pasta is an indulgence for me and I hardly ever ate it! Now I can eat it whenever I please! The contents of the package do smell when you open it but just rinse them immediately as the directions intruct and you will be fine! :),5

A2G243GES33YQA,"Great substitute: Heard about this pasta substitute and decided to give a try. I was very apprehensive of its texture (thought it was going to be chewy) but once I got past the fact that it comes in a watery bag, it actually tasted pretty OK. It's faaaaar from actually substituting pasta - taste wise - but if you're on a diet or just trying to avoid carbs, I would definitely recommend it! On another note, it is a little hard to digest it, at least for me.",4

A2K16OMHD1IZQC,"Love these noodles: I'm on a low to no carb diet and these noodles are amazing and really have satisfied my craving for noodles and pastas. I've made everything from pad thai with these, to fettuccine alfredo. Totally worth it.",5

A174NB43ZW1O0Z,NOT FOR ME.: They are not for me. I can't get pass the taste and consistency of the noodles. I have not tried the rice as of yet. I am not sure that I will. It is a personal preference. I just can't tolerate the taste at all.,2
A37G2JRCVOWULU,"Need a carb fix without all the carbs?  This may be your answer...: There have been plenty of reviews that say that these smell.  Yes, they smell when you open the package, but they need to be rinsed off after the initial draining.  After that, they are fine regarding smell.

For the three types that are in the box, they are all very similar in terms of taste (there is zero taste... like none), but not in texture.  The fettuccine noodles are the softest out of all of them.  They also have the least amount of smell.  They are definitely reminiscent of fettuccine noodles.  The angel hair pasta is some place in between and the rice is definitely the firmest.  It is also the smelliest and needs more than one rinse to get rid of the smell.  For comparison sake, they remind me a lot of rice noodles.

When it comes to preparation and you're using a liquid for flavoring, I would suggest adding more than you may typically add.  The noodles absorb the taste, but it's almost like tofu - it absorbs it so much that the flavor gets lost.  I did add some chili paste and sriracha (different dishes) and did notice that the noodles absorb everything.  The flavor doesn't last and all that was left to taste was the heat from the chili and the sriracha.  As with any pasta, these can be jazzed up any which way and they are a good carb fix in my eyes.  I don't think they are for everyone because they are so one note.  But, this works for me because regardless of my personal carb intake, it makes it impossible for me to maintain a particular weight or lose any and this is an adequate substitute.",4
A2L5RF7TI22NHV,... ordered this & 2 of the packages were no good. The liquid inside was hardly there & the ...: This is the second time I ordered this & 2 of the packages were no good. The liquid inside was hardly there & the supposed noodles were like plastic. Very disappointing:(,1
A2EE7KH0YTLJEG,"then put them in the frying pan on low for a few minutes and add your favorite spices (no butter or oil needed: Yes, they smell when you first open the bag.  Use a strainer and rinse thoroughly in hot water, then put them in the frying pan on low for a few minutes and add your favorite spices (no butter or oil needed, they won't stick).  They taste delicious after that!
These are also much easier to work with than the noodles in my opinion - the noodles taste good using this method as well, but they tend to stick together.",5

A381D4WB0IPDQF,"I love my noodle dishes but always felt horrible afterwards because ...: I was very pleasantly surprised by this noodle alternative.  Coming from an Asian household, I love my noodle dishes but always felt horrible afterwards because of the amount of calories and carbs.  To me, these are virtually indistinguishable form regular rice noodles like the kind you would find in lots of Asian recipes like Vietnamese pho.  These work well with Asian dishes, but using them with Italian fare may prove to be less successful.  As for the smell, I couldn't really detect any offensive odor, although I'm used to any sort of ""fishy"" smell which is typical of South-east Asian cooking anyways.",5
A1CLLHZZ93RIKA,"Poor quality!: I have had miracle noodles before and never been disappointed.  However, this box of spinach noodles was a BIG waste.  It was a box of 6.  1 bag was completely mush and had to be thrown away and 2 more bags were so clumped together and  hard I had to pull them apart!  Hald of my box was wasted.  Very disappointed!",1
A1FRUPO6DSTXE1,"Great for dieters!: I like these because they are guilt free and filling. I eat them at dinner because I tend to be a night eater if I don't feel full before bedtime. Would I eat them if I wasn't trying to watch my weight? Maybe not, but since I cut pasta and noodles from my diet -I eat low carb- I think these noodles are a great substitute for the real deal. I had to play around with them a bit for the right texture but now that I have it right I would say they are similar to many other Asian noodles. I haven't tried them with pasta sauce because I'm not sure I would like it. I make them in the microwave. I find the other methods worked, but I can't tell the difference between boiling and the microwave so why not save the time. I rinse them like crazy in hot water for about a minute, drain the water and microwave in a bowl for three minutes. I then add either chicken or beef stock and cook for a minute or two more. They remind me of Ramen noodles -not great but okay when hungry and wanting something quick. They are better if I take the time to add a little meat, sauteed onions and mushrooms. The noodles have no flavor alone. The only real con I can find is they do kind of give you a bloated feeling during digestion, not too bad, but I make a conscious decision not to eat them if I plan on wearing a figure fitting dress. PS They do stink raw, but I swear it goes away when washed and cooked. Enjoy!",5

A3QJDXSAQJIE9F,"I wouldn't call them ""pasta"" but I like them anyway.: I liked these noodles although you would never mistake them for pasta. I lost weight by adding them to my diet. That said, they are a little slimy and have an interesting taste. I put spaghetti sauce on them as well as folded them into stir fry vegetables. Would I eat them if I didn't want to lose weight. Probably not. But any zero calorie item that adds bulk to the diet and allows me to eat spaghetti sauce: winner.",4

I washed it more than they recommend and I let it sit in water and then rinse it before I boil it. I boiled it for more than the minute they recommended and then added it to Shrimp Scampi and it was unbelievably delicious. I will be always ordering this.,5
A3NTV9O2T3HG6M,Five Stars: Excellent alternative to rice and pasta when trying to cut the carbs.,5
A7WF3EEC38PNL,"Not too bad at all!: These were actually surprisingly good! They do smell a little when the package is first opened, but after a good rinse and boil the smell is gone. Since these ""noodles"" take on the flavor they are cooked in, I have found that they are GREAT for casseroles and sauces. In fact, aside from a small texture difference (this is why I gave 4 stars), they are actually pretty delicious when covered in butter or alfredo or whatever. Definitely a positive addition to any low-carb dieters so you won't feel totally left out while your family enjoys pasta. Even my kids will eat these!",4

When prepared correctly,  the noodles absorb a bit of the broth or sauce and have a decent texture. When not prepared correctly, the noodles release water and remain rubbery. They are fickle but worth the effort.

My favorite recipe is a creamed chicken made from  broth, a bit of evaporated milk, arrowroot, and, of course, chicken ... yum.",4

You question it, but if you're trying to be healthy, you overlook it towards the end result.  A true skeptic, I prepared this the first time and while in prep, thought of just devouring the French fries my husband had purchased for dinner sitting in the kitchen, all in my face.  I held tight and I'm so glad.  Soothing if simply with chicken broth, if you have a goal and this food helps you towards it, give it a chance and savor the moment.  It's worth it.  Add a seasoning if it's too foreign but otherwise, well worth it purchase.  I'm full now. :)",5

My warning, if you purchase these, open the boxes and check them all thoroughly before the point of no return.",1
A3KQGX05XGZLQ0,How to get rid of the smell: These are wonderful life carb noodles.  Taste great but smell like rotten fish.  I went on line and found out if you soak these in water with vinegar it smells like nothing.  Now I really really live these!,5
AR0GXZL6P4O7N,"Very interesting and not bad at all...: honestly, and very good low-carb pasta alternative.  of course its not the same, or as good, as 'normal' pasta.  however, for a low carb dieter, i don't see how you can do better than this as of right now.

the consistency (angel hair) is that of slightly over cooked oodles and noodles but with a more firm texture or bite.  its hard to explain; the noodles are very soft but slightly rubbery at the same time.  they come already soft in the package and really don't require any boiling at all, the directions recommend a quick blanching in boiling water for about a minute.  i find it better to saut the noodles (after rinsing them) in a skillet with olive oil or non stick spray to help keep them firm, and then add whatever sauce you're going to use.  the noodles absorb flavor, whether its sauce or seasoning, very well.

i did not notice any fishy smell or taste as some other reviewers have noted...",4

My husband ate one spoonful with his chicken sausage and picked around it. It was pretty hard to eat. I don't mind tapioca pudding or fish eggs for that matter, and with the flavor of the chicken sausage it was more tolerable than without. I tried eating his after I ate mine, I took one bite of it and had to spit that bite out. It just didn't taste good. I will find an alternative to rice and noodles for keto.",1

They didn't have the fishy smell which was great and had very little to no taste, but the texture was odd.  Kinda like eating tiny green beans that snap... hard to describe.  We followed the directions but maybe would have done better if we cooked it longer?  I am sure I would have gotten used to it, but my husband is a bit more sensitive to those things so we could not finish eating all of the items.  Worth a try if you are wanting to reduce carbs though.",3

AFYOWYXQDK0BH,"Comfort food at its best!: You have to rinse the rice good.  Then it takes on whatever flavors you are cooking with.  It is comfort food without the calories and carbs.  This is a staple in my house.  I add it to my homemade soups, cook it with laughing cow flavored cheese, fresh spinach, and add salmon and it taste like a really great dinner that normally would have at least 1,000 calories, but really has about 300.  This keeps me full and satisfied.  I highly recommend, especially if you are watching calories and like comfort food!",5
A26156TUIGCF3V,Very disappointed.: I bought this after reading the good reviews.  Would not buy this again nor recommend it.  No flavor at all and rubbery texture.  I actually threw away 3 packages and I rarely throw away food.  A waste of preparation and cleanup time and money.  So expensive.  Very surprised that anyone liked it and recommended it.  Would give it 0 stars if I could.,1

WOW: I have been using these products for approximately ten years delicious easy to make very filling delicious the rice is my favorite similiar to pastina growing up during my early years  but in all reality I can eat two LBS andnot feel guilty only 40 calories andbasically no fat GREAT THE BEST,5
A1M83GICZ9T7JO,"Great noodles for those who count calories!: The fact that these are healthy and calorie-free make up for their lack of taste in my opinion. If cooked according to instructions, they do absorb the flavors of anything you toss in with them - teriyaki sauce and chicken, duck sauce, fish sauce, any kind of marinade. Just make sure and run them under some water before boiling to get rid of the funny smell. They are very filling and it's hard to believe your daily calorie count does not suffer after a meal that includes them.",4

If you prefer mushy, try the the Miracle Noodle fetuccini...it's gross!! But the angel hair is to die for. Just rinse in a colander with hot water for a minute or two, then dry fry in a pan until the liquid's evaporated. Toss with whatever makes you happy and chow down.

It's surprising too.  It's a pouch of water with some sort of plant gel, like collagen, or whatnot.
Very low calorie, and pretty flavorless.  Definitely add mushrooms, soy sauce, meat, or something to it.
You need a wire strainer, because you're supposed to rinse it before cooking/eating.

Unfortunately, it's pretty expensive.  If you like mushrooms, you can get more bulk for lower cost there.",4

A3JFSXJ4YIY8E2,"Just ok: I really, really want to love these.  But I just don't.  Yes, they have a horrible smell when first opened (that the package warns you about).  They don't really have a taste to them and take on the flavor of the sauce you use so eating them plain would be a horrible idea.  I will say, they are better when you rinse them and then dry cook them in a pan with some butter or ghee.  But the texture just doesn't do anything to make me super happy and I'd much rather use my spiralizer to make my own veggie noddles.",3

A1CZJUNP12ML8G,"Gross: Ok so here are my thoughts on the miracle noodles I bought. First off, they have a strange smell when you open them, OK they stink. I knew they would based off what other people had said, but smell is a big thing for me, so I don't like that. The instructions tell you to boil them, and once you do, the smell is virtually gone. One person I watched on YouTube, cooked hers in a skillet after rinsing hers to remove excess moisture. So, that is what I did as well. They say that the soak up whatever sauce you use, which is mostly true too. In the back of my mind though I felt like I could smell/taste them, but I think it was my imagination. They have the same consistency of angel hair, but a slight different texture, more chewy. My husband liked them more than me, but pasta is his thing. I don't get cravings for it like he does. He said he would eat it again. I don't think I will though.",1
A2PTFTFHE4OZ2K,"Helps with weight loss, but texture is off: I tried it for quite a while. You have to rinse and cook them thoroughly. They're not bad... they're just not really good. Very chewy. kind of freaks me out when eating them. When adding a red sauce to it, that rubber texture does go away a bit. These would be fine for an alternative every once and a while, but not an every day thing, unless you are on a strict diet and don't mind.",3
A38ZRUDYAK4LLX,Interesting product: I gave this item 5 stars. Even though I haven't tried it yet. I can't take stars away from something unless i have experienced it.

I have however found it to be a perfect replacement for any chinese food. I will brown a  few shrimp, broccoli, add some fat free thai basil sauce, or pad thai sauce and mix in these noodles. 75 Calories, 20 Grams of protein.

A2DPJQ004DUZ9I,"Great option for when you're craving pasta: Great option for when you're craving pasta. One thing: I recommend pouring boiling water over the noodles and heating only slightly with butter, garlic, onion powder pesto sauce or tomato sauce. If you cook it like regular pasta, you'll end up with rubber noodles. Takes some prCtice

A1BDCCOUSDHKH5,"Even better the second time around: They did not appear to raise my blood sugar.

I've been on a low carb / ketogenic diet for nearly 3 months before a friend mentioned the words 'miracle noodles'.  Sure enough, a quick search turned these up.  A quick rinse, quick boil and then a little time in the fry pan and any one of the types (angel hair, fettucini, rice) make for a great base of a meal.  As simple as a pad of butter and parmesan cheese or even adding some Rao's sauce and they really do accept any flavor you combine with them.  Simple to make, easy to create new meal ideas and they satisfy that urge for a 'pasta' type meal.",5

I use it in Vietnamese soups such as pho(beef noodle soup), bun rieu (crab meat soup) and let me tell you its great. Closest to rice vermicilli or noodles. With out the carb and calories it gives you a guilt free pleasure for noodles. The only thing I would add is I found it cheaper to buy at local asian stores.",5

The only miracle will be if I can stay off the toilet.",3

So rubbery they are really only good for soup IMO. I just tried these noodles in a soup, and they only have about 5% rubber to them. Wow! I might actually feel safe enough to try patting them dry and putting pasta sauce on them next time like the back of the package suggests.

I do wish the noodles were cut a little shorter though, because these types of noodles don't really twirl right on a fork like a regular pasta does and it makes it a bit messy. Also, I find the translucent nature of the noodles slightly gross in my soup. I can't help it, but it's like a jellyfish or something and it makes me think psychologically that the noodles will be more rubbery than they actually are.",4

Unlike a normal noodle, you can't boil it so that it's more tender. I boiled them for 15 minutes and the texture stayed exactly the same. Seems unnatural. Also, they smell like plastic.

I used the ""rice"" the other day in a dish of sausage, onions and peppers with some asparagus all sauteed together, I rinsed the rice and then put them in the microwave and nuked them for 5 minutes, drained and rinsed them again and then dumped them in the sausage veggie mix, they soaked up the pan juices and were delicious. I've enjoyed the noodles in Asian style dishes and with spaghetti. I think I'll use the little ""rice"" balls in soup. I recommend these. I am only giving them 5 stars because they are obviously not pasta, but for what they are, they are great. :)",5

A36QAIQPX365EA,"Changed My Life: 200-calorie Macaroni & Cheese!: I've been working on eating healthy for two years now, after gaining weight in grad school.  I've tried a variety of recipes, but always ended up back at ""lean meat + vegetables"" which gets boringvery boringafter a while.  After I spent 2 months in China for work, I realized Euro pasta is just one way to do pasta!  These do not taste exactly like Euro pastathey have a different texture, and you have to work with them differently.  Like tofu (which I don't love, but it's a useful comparison here), cook in the flavor.  Give it seasoning and give it time; the seasoning and sauces won't just sit on the pasta like with Euro pasta.  Cook it into the noodles by simmering whatever you're using on the noodles for 3-5 minutes.

I've now made low-calorie versions of Beefaroni and Mac & Cheese, my two guiltiest comfort foods (comfort never grows up, I guess)!  As an adult, I'd eat an entire Kraft Mac & Cheese for a meal, and that's about 1,000 calories!  Now, I can make it myself using cheese powder, Miracle Noodle penne, and broccoli, and it's about 200 caloriesnearly all of which are healthy calories.  Much more satisfying, too!

COOKING TIP: To get that fishy flavor out, drain, rinse, then boil for 3-5 minutes with a touch of white vinegar (don't use apple cider vinegarI tried this once, and it's gross!).  Rinse again, and then cook with a sharp seasoning, regardless of what you're making.  Even when I make Mac & Cheese, I toss the noodles with teriyaki, for instance.  It makes the cheese taste stronger, and it all tastes great.  Teriyaki and low-sodium soy sauce are my two go-to's for this, but I'm sure others would work.

Other Tips:
- Boiling these noodles will not cause them to lose shape or get soft, like Euro pasta.
- Combine with veggies to turn your favorite meals into amazing, healthy options (I make my Mac & Cheese with equal parts Miracle Noodle penne/ziti and broccoli; and I do something similar with my ""Beefaroni"").  To make veggie-cooking easy and fast, I recommend frozen veggies cooked in steamer bags in the microwave.
- You can marinade these noodles.  Rinse, boil with a touch of white vinegar, rinse again, and then toss in a ziploc bag with your favorite marinade for up to a week.
- Not recommended for use in cold dishes like pasta salad, though if someone figures out how to make this work, I'd love to hear about it!
- Always, ALWAYS cook in the flavor rather than expecting it to sit on the pasta.  Simmer it, stir fry it, whatever you need, but cook it in.  The noodles will absorb the seasoning if you give it roughly 3 minutes.

Don't expect this to act like Euro pasta.  Focus on the ways it kicks Euro pasta's bum rather than the ways it doesn't measure up, and it will open up so many creative, healthy cooking ideas!

I can't tell you how endlessly happy I am now with my healthy diet.  No more boring repetition of the same ""lean meat + vegetable"" meals or depression on days when I just want comfort food.  Healthy comfort food has arrived!

I also recommend the ""rice"" and spaghetti noodles.  See picture for my Miracle Noodle fried rice!  Yummy!",5

I boiled them for a minute and then dry roasted in a skillet for a few minutes. They start to make a squeaky sound when done. While this is not identical to rice, it's not a bad substitute, especially for the low, low calories! I paired with a spicy vegetable curry to coat the ""rice"" in flavor and it made the meal feel more adequate and fluffier somehow. In some bites, the rice seemed more gelatinous (not necessarily rubbery but just tapioca like) but other bites I could almost forget it's not rice for a second. I probably could have dry roasted it more evenly, but I prepared  (and ate!) the whole 8 oz package.

AFTHSIEF730F3,"Can't believe how amazing these are: Before ordering these magical little things, I read many Amazon reviews complaining about smell/taste, etc. I decided to give them a try anyway, as I love pasta, and my husband and I have recently changed our eating habits for life following a lot of weight loss. I knew that if we went back to our previous pasta-heavy routine, the weight would just come right back. My extremely picky husband vetoed spaghetti squash and every other healthy alternative...and then I discovered these. It is very important to follow the instructions on the package. The noodles arrive packaged in some liquid that smells like a landfill/sewage treatment center combo. Not sure what it is, don't really want to know, as the smell goes away completely when the noodles are properly prepared. It does not affect the taste at all either. Instructions state to drain the noodles completely in a colander, and thoroughly rinse for 30 seconds. After I did this, there was no more odor at all. Then you have to boil them in water for 2-4 minutes, and then ""dry fry"" (in a skillet with no oil)after draining, to remove any excess water. That's it, the noodles are now ready. Do with them what you will. If the prep sounds labor intensive, it's really not...takes less than ten minutes. I plan on preparing several bags at a time, and then refrigerating them for later use. They absorb the flavor of whatever you put on them and are so delicious! Still can't believe that they are calorie-free. The noodles themselves are very long, so I snip them here and there while they're in the colander to make them easier to eat. And my husband likes them! SCORE!!!",5

While I did all of the above, I sauted chopped garlic and scallions in olive oil. I added some frozen cooked and peeled shrimp and sea salt and a bit more olive oil. I zapped some turkey bacon in the microwave (don't judge, I needed a quick meal) until it was crispy and chopped it.

When shrimp was thawed I added some garlic powder and sauted the mix for a minute. Added some light cream and the crispy bacon. Stirrred and simmered for a minute. Dished out the fettuccine, added the sauce, and topped it with chopped tomato.

I had my meal with wine - it was filling, creamy, and garlicky.",5

ARB9V2DWRBCG8,"has thus far been my favorite brand of shirataki pasta: The miracle noodle shirataki pasta, has thus far been my favorite brand of shirataki pasta. My favorite of the three is definitely the rice, which tastes very similar to Israeli couscous. My least favorite is the fettuccine, because it's so thick and large you can't really mask the gelatinous mouth feel of the shirataki noodles. To eat these I recommend rinsing the noodles until the odor goes away, boiling them for 3 minutes, and then ""dry frying"" them. By dry frying them, you get rid of any excess moisture the noodles have absorbed which gets rid of the gelatinous mouth feel.",4

AIM4CK1GK38O8,"Try it, you might like it as much as I did!: I love these noodles!
Spaghetti is my number one weakness, and since I'm watching my weight, I have to control myself from eating it everyday. This helps me so much because it's a no carb low calorie option. Even if I douse it in sauce, it's still less when I eat it with normal pasta. I'm not too keen on the rice one, the texture is just too off for me, but the fettucini and spaghetti noodle options are amazing.
A lot of complaints is about the smell. It does have a very distinct smell, and it takes some more effort to remove. First, rinse the noodles thoroughly. Just under tap water, let it run through until the smell has mostly disappeared. it takes patience, but it does happen eventually. Next, fry it a bit. This is crucial as it removes the smell for me. I saute it in a bit of olive oil, just let it dry out on the pan, before adding on the sauce.
It's great for dieters, but should not be consumed alone. I normally eat one for one meal, two or thee times a weak. Take not that it also helps in the digestion process, so bathroom visits are in order.",5
A18KAIMT987LDS,"Like many reviews said: Like many reviews said, these have a very bad aroma when you open them. However, when you rinse and cook them they are great. I did soak for a little bit as one reviewer had suggested. They are a great alternative to high carb noodles",5
A2F1MEFZSCQ31E,"Stinks like dead fish.: I never really write reviews, but I had to for this. This stuff is gross, it stinks like a dead, bloated cod fish washed up on the beach that your dog inevitably rolls in. It has the texture of silicon. I followed all of the written instructions on the bag to a T, (which were quite time consuming). You first attempt to wash off the dead cod stink. Then you boil it, to again calm the stink. Then you cook it again in a dry pan to remove the residual stink water from the balls of silicon. Then you enjoy what looks like silica dry pack beads, has the texture of dried silicon caulk, with no taste except for a mellow aftertaste of dead bloated cod fish. Tried pasta sauce to mask the nasty fish taste to no avail.

I do notice that these don't ""stick"" to your stomach very much so I was hungry again later but I think it also depends on what sauce or things you serve it with that will make the difference.

If you don't properly prepare them, then the fishy smell will linger.  As much as I like these for Asian-style dishes, I think it might be off-putting to use as a substitute in a traditional spaghetti, for example, since you are so used to expecting a certain texture.

So you absolutely can not go in this expecting them to taste like regular noodles, they're not going too. They basically take on the flavor of whatever you cooked, now the texture is a bit gummy and it does take a little effort to chew. It's tolerable, I'm happy. This is the angel hair version I believe. My advice, don't put a bunch on each forkful just put a bit with the other items and that helps. My two-year-old niece loves pasta, she enjoyed these.",4

A1BNRMIB2SQ1JY,"Rice without ""baggage""  and without rice!: Miracle Noodle is the brand name.  These are rice-shaped food-thingies,
or, as I prefer to call them, faux-rice.  They are not noodles, and they are not
rice either. They are rice shaped, and they are made from a root-vegetable.

What I appreciate about them is that they are very low in carbs and calories,
and they are also filling.  Which makes them a good choice for all sorts of diets.

They have no taste of there own. Zilch.  Nada.  And the texture is different
from real rice.  It's more like an Asian-noodle texture:  a little slippery.
I don't think you'll want to eat them alone, even if you are someone
who likes eat a bowl of rice without anything else in the bowl.  (I'm not that person.)
You'll probably want to eat this as part of a one-bowl meal, with a sauce and
with other ingredients.  Something like risotto.

Directions:  These come almost ready to use, packaged in liquid.
Empty the package into a strainer, let it drain out, and then
rinse the ""rice""  with water until the slightly musty packaging odor
disappears.  Then boil for a minute or two and drain it again.
Now add it to your food.  It's really quick and easy.

Note: Miracle ""noodles"" come in a variety of styles with names like
pasta and fettucini.  From my perspective, they all seem to have have
the same taste, texture and ingredients.  They only difference that I can
discern is the shape and the color.",5

I made a batch with red pasta sauce and that worked well, too. The noodles are a strange texture, but I just have to get used to them. One thing I really like is not feeling bloated and over stuffed after eating them. I read complaints about the bad smell, but after rinsing, no odor at all. Then you boil them and they are pretty odorless and tasteless. It's the illusion of eating pasta that works here.",5

I need to add that I have a very diverse palate, and love Sushi, Alligator, raw oysters and things that most people wouldn't try.  Keeping in mind that taste is always partially subjective, I'm writing about my experience with Shirataki noodles.  My first bite was a freshly cooked but cooled noodle. What quickly came to mind was biting into a live goldfish!! There were no further taste tries with me. (I have never eaten l live goldfish, but I can only imagine!)",1

A2KVQ9TWYCURB4,"Better than Noodles!!: I was very impressed with the ease of use and taste of these noodles.  I haven't had pasta for months now due to the low carb lifestyle I am living, and I wanted to make a simple spaghetti dinner.  I browned my meat with garlic and onions and added my low carb pasta sauce.  I drained the fettuccine pasta and then boiled them for one minute in hot water, and dried on a paper towel.  Then dumped them into the pan with the pasta sauce, gave it a quick saute and it was done.  Finished with some Parmesan and it was delicious.  Very satisfying and also I was surprised by the close nature of the texture.  It felt like I was eating noodles.  I am off to try other varieties of this brand.  :)",5

A33C54SGWSUHJ5,"No Calories or Carbs: As the advertisement says the noodles really have no taste to them.  They do have a slight bit of a strange odor.  I cooked them a couple of minutes longer than recommended to soften them up more since they do have a bit more chew than normal noodles.  After flavoring them up with my own sauce and some chicken, the meal was delicious!  The noodles just slide right down.  If you are on a special diet, this is for you.  Pricey, but very good and no calories or carbs.",4

So far they don't have any foul taste,  just taste like noodle to me. Of course not the EXACT same but not bad either.

A1X1592EDWIJU4,"Like Ramen Noodles: I bought the variety pack.  This review is for the angel hair noodles. I read positive and negative reviews.  The talk about fishy smell was off-putting but the lure of zero calorie ""pasta"" got me.  As stated elsewhere, the slightly fishy smell goes away quickly as soon as the noodles are rinsed.  I also took the advice of someone who said they used these like ramen noodles.  I love ramen noodles but not all those calories, so after I soaked the noodles and drained them, I cooked them for four minutes in one can of chicken broth (about 2 cups) with one tablespoon of soy sauce added.  The resulting broth was too salty for me so I drained the noodles again and added them to a can of Progresso chicken noodle soup.  The noodles were good plain,after draining the chicken broth/soy sauce, but I had already opened the Progresso soup so I mixed them in.  I really enjoyed the noodles. They tasted very much like ramen noodles.  Not a great difference in texture that I could tell. I definitely will buy these again.

Well, now I have tried the ""rice"" and fettuccini also.  The rice is really not anything like rice, more tapioca in appearance and texture.  I'm not very creative and I like chicken soup so I have prepared all three types the same way:  boiled for three minutes in chicken broth with soy sauce or just salted water, then drained and added to canned chicken soup.  I think they're good, especially considering the health benefit.  The noodles themselves don't taste like anything.  The fettuccini is kore like the width and texture of broad egg noodles, not really like fettuccini.  They're okay.  My favorite is definitely the angel hair, again more like good old ramen noodles.  That's what I will buy next time.  10/13/13",5
A2MLBUX9REGYUI,"Not for me,  not good.: I was surprised when this came in the mail and it was all suspended in water.  I haven't really given these too much time to grow on me,  as my overall first impression was disgust.  They smell bad, have a weird taste,  and dodge attempts to bite them by darting around.  Seriously,  you can hardly chew them.

I can't knock them too bad because they have their place with dieters,  and perhaps they would grow on a person over time, but they are completely unlike rice.",3

A24AI0S43UIKN9,"Ok if you can get past texture (10/13/2015 Edit: Great Low carb noodle soup): So I bought these noodles to fulfill my pasta craving on my keto diet.  Once you RINSE THEM THOROUGHLY,  they are not bad (in taste).  Actually, they have no taste and will truly take on the taste of whatever you put them in.  The problem I had was with the texture.  It is soft and mushy/swishy.  I prefer my pasta al dente anyway, so this was waaay too soft for my liking.  When you open the package initially, it does smell like salty sea water. After rinsing well, however, that smell went away.  So if you think you can tolerate the texture, this may be a great product for your low carb lifestyle.

EDIT:
As strange as this may sound, I actually started craving ramen noodle soup. By body can no longer tolerate real pasta. Enter Miracle noodles I actually forgot I had.  I rinsed & drained in cold water 4 times, then let it sit in a bowl of cold water about 20 minutes to get rid of the smell.  Then I put them in a pot; added chicken stock, leftover pork shoulder shreds, garlic, onion, parsley, Zataran's, and red pepper and I got some darn good low carb ramen noodle soup.  Awesome! I will have try other recipes now, but in the soup, the texture of the noodles is a lot more tolerable.",3

This site is misleading and I will definitely let amazon know this as well. So, be wary.

Addendum:
Spoke with Amazon customer service and she was very helpful. They are going to send me out another order of the 6pack fettuccine I thought I ordered again.

I found myself struggling to keep them down, even with lots of deep breathing and water.  Now the thought of returning to the bearable fettuccine is making me sick to my stomach and wanting to throw up the rice I ate several hours ago.

These things aren't too bad if you're used to eating seaweed, since they taste a lot like it.  But, for heaven's sake, don't try the rice or plain noodles.  Good god, they're horrible.  I want to light my stomach on fire just knowing that there are remnants in there.",3

Package is mostly water, a few noodles are contained within so i will not buy again anyway due to pricing even if it tasted good. If you're desperate for a no calorie or carb product then this would be okay if you can manage to choke it down.

1. Open bag
2. Hold nose.  The stuff it swims in is very fishy and strong smelling.

HOW TO PREPARE THEM
I personally soak my shirataki noodle for 5/10 minute under water..especially these stinky one! ;) They I prepared them with almost every sauce...I often do Chinese style or Thai style noodle with shirataki!
I found out that the way to have them taste good is to let them cook for 10/15 minute with the sauce...",3
A24U9C5CHC0HZH,"great substitute for regular noodles: These things can be a wonderful addition to one's diet provided they are prepared properly.
1. The smell out of the bag is slightly fishy, but it goes completely away after serious rinsing in cold water. I don't mean 10 seconds, I mean leave them under running water and swish them around so they are thoroughly rinsed.
2. It helps to boil them for about three minutes after rinsing.
3. After boiling and draining I like to dry fry them on a frying pan (lightly oiled) to remove more moisture and to improve the texture.
4. These noodles, especially the thick kind are best used in Asian dishes with heavily flavoured sauces/broths, especially if they are given some time to soak in the sauce, as they have no taste of their own. I've made Thai and Chinese dishes with them that were practically indistinguishable from the real thing.
5. While I have made tomato based dishes with them (vegetarian spaghetti bolognese to be precise), I still needed to saute the noodles in the tomato sauce and not just pour some sauce on top of the cooked noodles.
6. They keep me full for hours, like a solid meal, without the pasta-related ""sleepiness"".
7. I have recommended them to my parents and my diabetic father is finally able to eat noodle based dishes without having to worry about his sugar.
8. Leftovers can be refrigerated and usually taste even better (the noodles have even more time to soak in the flavour).

All in all I love shirataki and they have become a staple in my lunch rotation.",5

The texture of these was extremely rubbery and not food-like....a quality I prefer in my food items!  Regardless, I'll be trying to locate that original brand I found in Seattle.  Now I still have 5 bags left.  Recommend knowing what you're buying when you buy a six pack.

I recall the other noodles being smaller in diameter which may help to make the noodles less rubbery in the mouth.",2

For the Singapore Noodles I rinsed them, dried in a pan, then followed a random recipe i found. for the Taco Meat I rinsed and dried them in a pan, then threw them in, it was good to go. Made the Pho by rinsing the angel hair, warming it in the broth i was cooking them just dumping them on top of my meat and stuff and pouring the boiling broth over it all.

I can smell the briny odor when I open the bags but it passes after the rinse, and I've been actually sniffing it to see.

That said, it's been three weeks and I've had no bread, chips, crackers, tortillas etc...while my family was eating pizza tonight during the NFL draft, I chose to give these a try.

I saut&eacute;ed some chicken with onions and carrots, added the trader joes tai curry sauce and let simmer...

While that was going I followed the directions precisely on these noodles...they did smell and looked a bit different but, once I added the chicken dish to the noodles, the smell went away.

How'd it taste?  Well, noodles in general don't ""taste"" like much.  The ""texture"" was a bit different than traditional noodles.  But, with the sauce, chicken and vegetables mixed in, this dish did fulfill my carb/bread craving.  I also felt incredibly fool after one helping so that's perfect too.

I'd say to invest in these if your trying to lose weight...it will help avoid bread products!",4

They don't necessarily fill you up-- but they help as a calorie-free side with light pasta sauce!

Recently when I ordered these, they were COMPLETELY different! I ordered the exact same product from the exact same place (Amazon). They used to be somewhat thicker and the texture wasn't bad at all. They were the exact same thickness as regular ""angel hair"" pasta. This time, the noodles were extremely thin-- almost like a ""pinworm"" thickness-- gross! It didn't absorb the pasta sauce well at all, like it used to, and I have no idea why all of a sudden the thickness changed! They were also really rubbery.

AW865UZA1VGOQ,"Good for what they are!: If you're expecting a rice/noodle replacement to be exactly like rice/ noodles, you're going to be disappointed with everything you find.
The directions are right on the bag- people who are saying this is too complicated must be used to eating everything from a box because they aren't hard at all and considering I used to make my own egg noodles easy to prepare. The rice is never going to be rice-like due to the fact that they just cant cut it as small as actual rice. The noodles are really good though. All you have to do is have a decent sized metal mesh strainer in addition to a cooking vessel of some type and you can make these. You put water on to boil. When its at a rolling boil, rinse the product thoroughly with cool water in the strainer. Then dump it in the boiling water. Then cook it for about two minutes. Then drain it. Dump the water out of your pot and put it back on the heat. Dump the product back in and gently stir until you either quit getting steam (for the rice or for al dent pasta) or the steam is greatly reduced (angel hair for a ramen like texture in stir fry). At that point put whatever sauce you are using on it or mix it with your stir fry.
I wouldnt use it for a steamed rice sub, but it was good with seasonings for Mexican rice.

However, if you are expecting the taste and the texture to be like regular spaghetti noodles, this isn't for you.  I probably loved them based on the fact that I am an all type of noodle lover.  The texture is kind of like vermicelli noodles meets jellyfish (you'll know what I mean if you ever had jellyfish).

A1RNC4HNHALSJ1,"Takes some getting used to: I've been eating Miracle Noodle noodles exclusively for the last year-ish, so I was familiar with the consistency and the initial odor that comes with this product. Like the noodles, the rice needs to be rinsed a few times and then boiled for about 3 minutes if you're going to eat it as is, without anything else.  However, I recommend rinsing and drying it well, then sauteeing in soy sauce or whatever sauce you like.  I've made stir fry multiple times with the miracle rice, I've put it in soups, and I've eaten it plain with butter and seasoning.  It really turns out well however I try it.  My son's a picky eater, and he at it without a single complaint.  It takes on the flavor of whatever you cook it with, and as long as you have veggies or meats cooked with it, there's no real shock when it comes to the texture (which is similar to a canned mushroom...kind of rubbery...when on it's own).

Upon opening the box filled of them, I was scared. They box they come in is very heavy, the packages look like mush upon first glance, and over-all it seems... frightening. But I wanted my pasta sauce, badly. So I rip into an angel hair box, follow the directions closely because the scent the bag was emitting could only be compared to a bottle of uncapped fish oil being left in the sun for 48 hours, and slam down some pasta sauce directly on these bad boys.

Let me describe to you the appearance of these noodles. Terrifying. They look like the strings on a jelly fish, and appear to have a similar texture. They're this ghostly opaque white color and essentially look like what you would imagine ectoplasm turned into a noodle dish would look like. I was scared. Quaking in my boots. But I picked up my fork because I'm a woman who eats very little and counts every calorie, and I wanted pasta so bad on this night.

Fortunately, when I ate them, I was pleasantly surprised. They don't taste fishy. Their texture is a little unique but it's like.. rubbery in a good way in my opinion. Sort of like overcooked ramen but more palpable. I would definitely recommend these to my friends if they are looking for a miracle noodle. They absorb the flavor or any dish you cook and I cannot wait to make some kind of sushi with the rice in these packages.",5
A1SSTWY0UQ2OR1,"Not worth it for me, even though I love(d) low carb: This was an incredibly tough decision when deciding how I was going to rate these ""noodles""... and using the quotes probably gives it away.  These are definitely NOT noodles, in any capacity!  They look odd, they smell awful, and they don't taste like anything.  People tend to say that they soak up the flavor of whatever they are cooking into it, but I found them to have no flavor no matter how much flavor I put into it.

That being said, I can't give it one star because it is a decent filler if you really want to have no carbs but want ""rice"" or ""noodles"" or something that pretends to be them.  If you REALLY want to, I would pick the ""rice"" and use it with your low/no carb chinese dishes.  The noodles are just too crazy for me.

Also, beware the next day when you go to the restroom.  it may look a little... odd.",2
A1JB11SOAYFNUH,Five Stars: These noodles are a godsend.,5
A1P6DSYZLEY0G2,"If you are doing Keto and are missing rice, ...: If you are doing Keto and are missing rice, this is as close as you are going to get.  No, it's not Basmati - nothing is a substitute for heaven.  However if you do decide on this product, make sure you dry it well after the boil.  By doing so it will be less rubbery and will absorb the curry or sauce.",4
ASSY5WVT94QTO,fishy smell: these noodles have a very nasty smell to them.  You have to rinse them several times or you will also taste the fishy smell!,1
AQ866OQ8ZBGNQ,"Worth trying: This is a carb-free, calorie-free, plant based product that is unusual, but I think worth trying. You have to rinse it very well to remove the characteristic ""smell"" before using it. Like tofu, don't try eating it plain. It absorbs whatever flavors you add to it. Once rinsed you can use it like cooked rice: I like to quickly stir fry it with veggies, small shrimp or bits of chicken, soy sauce, a beaten egg & nutritional yeast--tastes just like fried rice.",3
A3D2SFUVGN3LTP,smells fishy but: takes on the taste of what you cook it with so that being said it is what it is yup.,4
A2O6SQ63OVP4ZK,yay: terrific taste,5
A2GXETSHH2MVP,Tasted funny: Taste was fishy...did not taste good at all. I was so excited to think this would be an option for me as a diabetic.  Not!,1
AOTDOHCBJ4I9O,Five Stars: it's a good substitute for pasta,5
A11C5BLCDGF5XI,"Much better than competitors!: Far better than Skinny Dip noodles. The smell is fishy, yes, but the taste is much better than others I have tried and they are FAR less rubbery. Great deal, too!",5

A21LLLRYO4PEHH,"The texture of these noodles is so awful, I ...: The texture of these noodles is so awful, I couldn't get through more than 3 bites. I'm generally not a picky eater but these noodles went straight to the trash. They are thick noodles with a gummy-like consistency. I told my fiance I'd rather not eat than consume these. Yuck, yuck, yuckity yuck.",1
AEHEOJUZ3DST1,not for me: thesse taste WAY too garlicky,2
AK9M9BSRSY2DJ,"Five Stars: great stuff, no carbs taste the sauce",5
A2UZ7U4TFP9OMM,In love: Absolutely in love with these noodles.  I have to eat a grain free diet and this is my ONLY way to eat pasta.  I am so excited I found these and have shared with severs friends with gluten intolerance.,5
A211EWMFB03XRN,don't think I can get used to and enjoy them.: odd taste and feel. don't think I can get used to and enjoy them.,3
A2TDZE9SS4I5IN,"love this: We are moving into healthier eating and this noodles are awesome!  Love the taste and texture.  will order again, you have to rinse when you first open, boil water dip for a few minutes and done!!!  Enjoy with favorite sauce",5
A2PRMF5MT23IYA,"Disgusting and rubbery: Supposedly it takes on the flavor of the sauce you use, but I found it to be flavorless and rubbery! I have a ton left and no one will even take them for free!",1

Expect a fishy smell before U rinse, rinse, rinse, but absolutely no fishy taste
I steam for 2-3 min in the microwave (a little plastic steamer)
then throw them in pan w/ whatever, I like onions and peppers, a little teriaki.
very good !",5

A3E62YI8FWCYEN,"Do not insult your tastebuds: The texture, no matter what you do, is off putting.  It is like chewing on rubber bands.  Thumbs down on this noodle.",1
A1SH7QYUCC32QP,Five Stars: Awesome low-carb alternative to traditional pasta.,5
A4AOPFX6LDBPC,"Love it: I love these noodles, specifically because they are soy-free which I can't find in stores. As far as the texture, I don't have any problems with it. You are supposed to boil them for one minute.",5
A14VIW6TDFKPS5,"Great product: Having read other reviews, I made sure to rinse the ""rice"" for a good 8 minutes. Although preparing it requires more effort than real rice, it takes less time to actually prepare and if you season it correctly, it tastes great!",5
A15XEOLUK6ACGK,Three Stars: This brand has little fiber compare to the other brand.,3
A1ZKXPRG243KNR,Three Stars: OK,3
A2YWDSSP1NYEKJ,Five Stars: Easy to prepare- just add veggies for quick low calorie dinner or lunch,5
A261Q0W0TLKFS0,"Cool but disappointed.: Really cool to try out but the texture of the noodle is gross. I couldn't eat the mac and cheese, it is chewy and doesn't feel like pasta. I know it's not pasta but still just each the real stuff and get the calories and work out later not worth the price. The texture is like chewing on a wrapper or something I can't even describe it ! very disappointed.",1
A1P436NW83QQVU,One Star: Absolutely awful taste texture and cooking process. Would never purchase again. Literally made me ill after eating.,1
A1JP98F41KL6CQ,Yuck!: Packed poorly & one bag of noodles leaked everywhere. Smelled like rotton fish! For that reason I'd will not order again!,3
A1YVB08PIT77IS,"it was like eating: So gross, it was like eating tentacles",1
A3LZZ99N4SIX7N,"The only Miracle is being able to eat them: I'm a health nut and live a very strict lifestyle in terms of diet so my review isn't from someone who doesn't like something because they are expecting the real thing.  I see that all the time as people just don't want to make lifestyle changes and make excuses for continuing to eat poor.  With that said, these noodles are a disaster.  I have to question some of the reviews and the validity of them, my opinion of course.  These noodles have very odd instructions, and the result is an EXTREMELY rough texture.  Good luck trying to cut or separate the noodles.  It's almost impossible to not have to eat all of them at once.  You seriously don't even feel you are eating something editable and it has nothing to do with taste.  I've been eating Shirataki noodles for years, but decided to give these a try just for the heck of it.  I've tried all of them and they are all the same.  I'll stick with Shirataki. It's not even close.  I'm sure the company will tell me I'm not cooking them right.  Let's see, 15 secs cold water, 1 minute blanche, and paper towel to dry.  Ok, did all that (Shirataki you just heat in water) and expected them to soften but they never do.  I hope I can save some of you the money you are about to spend.",1
AAWL2SAX6UY8S,Five Stars: Aaaaa,5
A7R8I5F6SE5QG,"Just okay.: Not my favorite brand of Shirataki noodles.  I've tried several different brands and as a low-cal or no-cal alternative to noodles, they are wonderful.  This particular brand I find to be a bit lacking - some of the noodles come out thin and hard, almost like paper and they don't plump up when you rinse them, boil them, or add items to them.",3
A2HLO10HRPI5KN,"Delicious!: I love these noodles! They are absolutely delicious, I've tried cooking them several ways but found the best way to do it so to put them in a colander and drain them, then saute them for a bit to remove excess moisture. Lastly I just make my own sauce and serve them.

Warning: If you have IBS or a weak digestive system these will give you diarrhea for at least a week while you eat them. The only way to get around this is to continue eating them until your digestive system gets used to them.

Lastly, I heard you can get these at local Japanese stores for much cheaper but I'm a lazy so whatever!",5
AD0OENWU7N4L6,Great Addition!: I have been ordered by the old MD to eat low carb due to inflammation issues. This has been a life saver for a pasta addict like myself. Preparation is easy and just sitting in any sauce for a while will enable these to take on many delicious flavored. The noodles are as good as the sauce you pair it with. Fills me up and makes me happy.,5
A2SQD2XZ6KU9I7,"Great diet product.  Fills you up.: Tastes great, texture is surprisingly good (especially seeing how it looked in the package. i expected it to be soggy and gross - it wasn't) and easy to prepare.",5
A183JLR4WUV3LC,"Great replacement: Yes, these noodles smell pretty horrible right out of the packaging and the noodles are extremely long. Trim the noodles and follow the cooking instructions on the package and the noodles will be just fine. These noodles DO taste different and they DO have a different consistency; they are obviously not made from the same ingredients as regular pasta. Keep in mind that comparing pasta noodles and Miracle Noodles will leave you disappointed.

I don't buy these noodles because Im watching my weight; I simply buy them because Im a type 1 diabetic and this allows me to do less insulin for meals that consist of (or partially consist of) the Miracle Noodles. I enjoy making these noodles for myself as a simple pasta replacement. Ive purchased the Angel Hair noodles and the rice and they're enjoyable when cooked correctly. I would recommend these to a friend who has realistic expectations :)",4
A2XVYEWMCGOEJY,"These are great! Each package only serves two: These are great!  Each package only serves two, but if you want something to add substance to your meal without the calories, fat or carbs, this is the way to go!  My father who is a diabetic, likes them too.",5
A29USZD55VZYXF,"These are just nasty.: Everyone has different tastes, I could not get past the horrible smell, no matter how many times I rinsed them.",1
A24AX9S24POTJT,"Excellent- we are not going to buy regular pasta anymore ...: Excellent- we are not going to buy regular pasta anymore. This doesn't bind up, so no trouble eating it- and since there's no taste, it holds the flavor of the sauce without changing it. It's quick to make- and with 0 carbs, calories and sugars, can eat all we want",5
A2WKILMW57L78B,"Fail!: I had high expectations for this product, I mean, what a great concept! Too bad the actual product is a complete fail.
First off, instead of being packaged like a normal noodle (dried and just needing to be cooked), it comes in a water filled pouch, so it looks like white worms floating around, bleh!

Anyway, I followed the directions: Drain, Rinse, Boil, Rinse, Dry(in a separate pan to remove moisture)... Wow! Already too many steps..
Now, for the taste test. Nothing! no taste at all. But wait! the texture is soooo odd, think... rubber bands.

Nope! Not for me.  Submitted a return.",2
A2J7NTHKFA8HTV,"Angel hair Shirataki noodles: Out of 6 packs ordered , one pack was hard/tough , not of the same texture as the other five ??  I saved it so it can be returned - I would appreciate a replacement for that one.  The others we enjoy !",3
A10ETTF4GIM0X1,Yuck!: Do not like at all! Texture is horrible,1
A1MFWR5222RQ6Q,"Very Versitile!: I have these on auto delivery....I have them every night for dinner.  Like tofu they take on the flavor you cook them with. They add the extra bulk with out the added calories!  Make sure you chop them up (except the Rice, which is ready out of the bag)before adding to your sauce!  Love them!",5
AU8NWB4ZX1KZ8,"good but costly: I rinse, then boil, drain, and then add to the dish.  It is almost like a glass noodle and works well. Great idea but I deducted one star due to price.  There is a smell on opening but not a bad I was expecting based on other reviews.  I would say it is a good glass noodle replacement for soups or Asian dishes but I can't see using it with typical spaghetti sauce.",4
A3V20X2O88KRVK,One Star: Yuck. No getting past the rubbery texture.,1
A2R1VCV9QJAWFR,"No smell or funky taste: I was little hesitant about this, because I read about it, and read the reviews, especially about the terrible smell, taste, etc.

What I got did not have any taste after I followed the directions. Wash it in cold water couple of times, then let it sit there for a bit, then take it out and drain it.

I'm almost convince that it's the water that people wash these in that's making the noodles taste funny, because they do take on taste of basically anything you mix this with, including water.

It was actually delicious. Just cook it little al dente.",5
A1DARKXTBUZL01,Love: I was buying the angel hair miracle noodle pasta and decided to try this one. I LOVE this one and will be buying it going forward much better than the angel hair pasta,5
A1CZT7VF8CEAM2,Love these noodles: Love these noodles.  Im on a very strict diet and these are perfect for me.  The best way to cook them in my opinion is in a frying pan.  You get the best texture this way.,5
A32DUOHB8GDE6K,"Not bad for what it is meant to do: Not bad for what it is meant to do.  For those on diets and trying to avoid carbs, it serves a good purpose.  When mixed and eaten with meat and/or a sauce, then, if not too critical, you will be satisfied with your ""noodle"" side dish.  Alone, they have no taste.  Easy to prepare.",3
A2KPVDO8O5SAKZ,Shipping problems: Product arrived several days after it was supposed to come and was frozen rock solid. Most of the noodles were ruined and came out like a loofah sponge in texture and had to be thrown out. 1 rice and 1 noodle were undamaged and seemed to be fine however so I did give it a better score than otherwise.  Would be a lot happier if the carrier doing the delivery would replace what they ruined.,3
A2RWQ4D204NGWJ,Four Stars: Very good but kinda pricy.  Each packet is a single serving.  Wish I could find these or comparable locally.,4
A2NBSS6HF4JCV1,Not tasty at all: Weird texture and flavorless. Overall gross.,1
AN6AWJMPODRCG,"So very wrong: I'm an extraordinarily adventurous (and ethnic) eater (of all non-meat items), including all manner of odd, plant-based substances while traveling in Asia; however, I was not prepared for the (1) smell and (2) texture (!) of this item. Admittedly, the smell dissipated after much rinsing (far longer than the 10-15 seconds recommended), but it never completely left. Because it was my first time using these ""noodles,"" I paired them with a spicy sauce just in case they were bland. It turns out the lack of flavor isn't the issue; the few bites I managed to get down were of such a foul and unfamiliar texture that I was nauseous from the start. In fact, I was nauseous just looking at them disappear down the disposal after I gave up. I can honestly say that I have never experienced this texture and I hope to never repeat it. Sadly, I bought a sample pack of 6- all of which were immediately relegated to the garbage.",1
A1Q62FNPMU8M3A,Miracle noodle quality and quantity has gone down - buy Skinny brand as better replacement instead: The Miracle Noodle brand has lowered their quality and standards for at least their rice product. I used to buy this all the time until the last batch delivered was all liquid and didn't quite yield 1/2 cup of shredded product. It did not look like rice anymore either but shreds of product waste instead. See attached pictures. Very disappointed - I will not buy again. I started buying the Skinny brand of rice and it is pleasantly what you wud expect.,1
A1I7E0D7MFHBP8,No fettuccini please: The rice and the angel hair is good. I really do not like the fettuccini. I guess they are just to thick. They have the same flavor and texture but its better on a smaller scale like the angel hair.,4
A3U0UVMQWR2WYO,"some did not like the texture: I took a risk on these with all the reviews talking about the off-putting smell.  Yes, it has a smell.  Certainly not as offensive (to me) as many reviews would have one believe.  Rinse 15 seconds, boil two minutes--completely odorless.  Likewise, some did not like the texture.  I have used it only with homemade spaghetti sauce and it is so convincing.  Very pleased with this option to pasta.  Just placed my second order!",5
AL79WV2KVUNUS,Disappointed: All but one of the bags was leaking water all over. I couldn't even use them because the bags were damaged along with the contents.,1

I'm not sure what the difference is since they both have konjac, but the smell is almost unbearable. I rinsed the rice several times, and it barely came off. I saut&eacute;ed it with garlic and onions, but the texture as well was too different for me.

I think I will stick to the regular stuff and just emphasize on portion control.",2

A132Y8PLTXY4GN,"OUTSTANDING!!!: I was skeptical about ordering these as some reviews were negative, however, curiosity got the better of me and I ordered a 6-pk case.  I am sure glad I did.  Yes, when you open them they smell like fish, however, I don't mind the smell of fish as we have it about twice a week.  Rinse well under cold water in a colander and drain.  Immediately put noodles, not colander, in boiling water for 3 minutes.  Pour off water.  Add whatever sauce you are using and let it sit for about 15 minutes in the hot pan.  EAT.  The noodles absorb the sauce taste and you can't tell them from regular noodles.  They truly are a miracle.  Plus they add extra fiber to your diet which is woefully lacking in American's diets.  Try them, just follow the directions.  Oh I almost forgot, the seller of this item is great.  Received it in less than a week.",5
A17YIYX48Z0KHF,Good in traditional Japanese dishes: I use this in traditional Japanese dishes like sukiyaki and mizutaki and we love it!  I have tried it as ramen but it didn't taste very good as ramen. It has a rubbery texture. I like the fact that there are hardly any calories.,5
A2AVT42HELI0SK,"Nabe time!: Not much flavor, but that can be a good thing. I used to live in Japan, where this was always available in stores....and, cheap! Great in nabe (one-pot meals).",4

I rinse them really well and then let them drain and pat dry. Then I boil them in some chicken broth or fry them in a pan with chili sesame oil depending on how I'm using them. They work well for me as a low carb/gluten free noodle.

Of course they aren't going to taste the same as the real thing but as long as you go into it not expecting it to taste like 5 star italian fettuccine you won't be disappointed.",5
