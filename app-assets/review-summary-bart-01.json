They smell a little when they first open the package, but after boiling in water they get better. The texture is good and they taste good. They are great in the chicken teriyaki I made the other night. They also work well with my homemade pasta sauce with ground turkey, so I'm going to make some \"Ketogenic\" stir fry chicken, Bok Choy and noodles for dinner tonight. The noodles are fat free and low or no calories, so they don't have to worry about calories.", "summary-low": "The Shirataki noodles are rubbery in texture and don't absorb the cooking sauce. They are impossible to cook. They have a bad smell. They don't have a lot of calories, but they are good for watching calories. They taste bad. They smell bad, they make a mess, and they are difficult to prepare. I want to return them and get my money back. I made taquitos in my toaster oven, but I didn't want to eat them, so I will try again later. I will go back to using spagetti squash and brown rice.   "}
