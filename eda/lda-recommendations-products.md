The insights from the high-rating reviews highlight what customers appreciate, while the low-rating reviews reveal areas that need improvement. Here are the recommendations:

### Recommendations for Improving the Product

#### 1. **Enhance Flavor and Texture**
   - **High-Rating Insight**: Positive reviews frequently mention "taste," "flavor," and "texture" as key factors for satisfaction.
   - **Low-Rating Insight**: Negative reviews often criticize the "taste" and "texture," describing them as "slimy," "rubber," and "gross."
   - **Action**: Conduct a thorough review of the product's flavor and texture profiles. Consider reformulating the product to improve these aspects, possibly by using higher-quality ingredients or adjusting cooking instructions to achieve a better texture.

#### 2. **Address Odor Issues**
   - **High-Rating Insight**: While some high-rating reviews mention "smell," it is not a predominant concern.
   - **Low-Rating Insight**: A significant number of low-rating reviews highlight a "strong," "fishy," and "horrible" odor.
