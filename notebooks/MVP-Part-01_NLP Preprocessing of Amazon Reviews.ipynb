I gain weight easily, so I'm obsessive about counting my calories, but many times I am left not feeling very full. I read about these noodles and decided to give them a try. Out of the bag, they do smell like fish, but that goes away after rinsing them. And yes, the texture is like chewing rubber bands. I have tried all the tricks (boiling for 30 minutes, frying them until they are completely dry), and nothing changes the texture. But the good thing is that they do take on whatever flavor you cook them with, so I try to make them as flavorful as possible! In the end they leave me feeling very full, and more importantly, guilt free. To me, that is worth it, so I am willing to tolerate the texture.

       "4  What's important to you?: So how bad do you want to restrict your calories? I gain weight easily, so I'm obsessive about counting my calories, but many times I am left not feeling very full. I read about these noodles and decided to give them a try. Out of the bag, they do smell like fish, but that goes away after rinsing them. And yes, the texture is like chewing rubber bands. I have tried all the tricks (boiling for 30 minutes, frying them until they are completely dry), and nothing changes the texture. But the good thing is that they do take on whatever flavor you cook them with, so I try to make them as flavorful as possible! In the end they leave me feeling very full, and more importantly, guilt free. To me, that is worth it, so I am willing to tolerate the texture. If texture is very important to you, then don't bother trying these or they will just gross you out."

Boil them in a pot for 3 mins, then rinse again (pat dry with paper towels and try to squeeze out as much liquid as possible). Now put them in your already heated non stick skillet. I do this on a setting of 3 on the glass top stove.\\n\\nAt this point, because I've never read where someone has said how much time to do this for, I've been kind of guessing or listening for 'squeakiness'. I just now made these and decided to extend the time for this part. Not sure if it was the extended time or that simply these noodles are better than the ones I've gotten at walmart, but these were really really good.

       "      <td>ZERO CALORIES, ZERO CARBS and EXACTLY like spaghetti. Miracle noodles, indeed. Changed my life!: This product has seriously changed my LIFE. I fight every day to keep my weight at its current level, and I simply must avoid carbs. The conflict is that my favorite food, since I was a child is spaghetti with meat sauce. Until I learned about this nearly unbelievable product, I  had to eat spaghetti sauce on bean sprouts (ugh!) or green beans (yuck) or spaghetti squash (wahhhh!) and people say they can pretend they are eating spaghetti but those substitutes are nothing like real noodles. AND THEN I FOUND MIRACLE NOODLES AND MIRACULOUS THEY ARE, INDEED! iMAGINE HOW this could exist: noodles that are EXACTLY like normal noodles, except they have ZERO CALORIES AND ZERO CARBS. It's almost like dreaming, to try to grasp that this product could even exist. I was once warned AGAINST this product by someone who said it tastes awful. It turns out that she did NOT follow the instructions on how to prepare them. When they come out of the bag, they smell like fish! You will worry and think there is no hope. But just go forward following the directions exactly. A lot of rinsing, 2 minutes of boiling, then a little while of cooking them in a dry pan. Is ANY kind of spaghetti so fast to prepare? And then you couldn't tell them from real spaghetti in a million years.  I will be very disappointed in you if you say there is anything imperfect about these, because if you say that, then I know you didn't follow the instructions carefully. I love them so much, I gave them as Christmas gifts. No one could believe it! ALL YOU CAN EAT spaghetti with no calories or carbs!!! Now I have subscribed to have them delivered monthly. I have to say you are simply out of your mind if you don't try these. You can eat ALL THE SPAGHETTI YOU WANT NOW. How did anyone create these? I don't know. But they are a MIRACLE and really changed my life.\\n\\n&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Zero-Carb-Gluten-Free-Shirataki-Pasta-Fettuccini-7-Ounce-Pack-of-6/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodle Zero Carb, Gluten Free Shirataki Pasta, Fettuccini, 7-Ounce (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt;</td>\n",

Because I am on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;diet, which prohibits the consumption of wheat &amp; any product made with wheat (pasta, bread, crackers, etc.) and I LOVE pasta &amp; noodles, which are my favorite food after sushi, steak &amp; shellfish, I was so glad to find the Miracle Noodle angel hair and fettucine pasta.\\n\\nHowever, even though&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is primarily a wheat-free diet, because its also supposed to be low-carb &amp; grain-free, other non-wheat grains &amp; starchy carbs like rice, potatoes and corn are discouraged (or at least advised to only consume in very limited amounts as rarely as possible)\\n\\nUnfortunately I LOVE basmati rice -- especially when having it with the \"Morey's Seafood\" brand of \"Seasoned Grill Wild-Caught Alaskan Salmon\" which I get from the frozen food section at Costco (and prior to that, at Sam's Club) and ever since I started the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;diet, I was missing having rice so much that I mostly stopped eating the Morey's Seafood Seasoned Grill Salmon, because it just wasn't the same without the fluffy &amp; buttery basmati rice to enjoy it with.\\n\\nThen I happened to see a listing for this Miracle Noodle Rice while ordering the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Angel-Hair-Pasta/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodle Angel Hair Pasta&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and I knew I just HAD to try it.\\n\\nNow before going any further, I just wanted to clarify that when I ordered this&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Rice/dp/B00BP36S7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodle Rice&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;I had NO illusions whatsoever that this would taste like basmati rice, in any way! Even before I ordered this, I knew it would be difficult if not impossible to replicate the taste &amp; texture of basmati rice into a no-carb calorie free version. So despite the name of the brand, I was NOT expecting a miracle. However, while I knew that it would probably not taste like basmati rice -- I was hoping that it would at least taste like SOME kind of rice.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I was wrong! Not only does it not LOOK like rice but it also does NOT taste like ANY kind of rice either!\\n\\nThis so-called \"rice\" is a bunch of tiny white little balls, that kind of look like caviar (though I've never had caviar, this looks like a white version of it!) or tapioca. In fact, when I made this for a close friend, one of the first things she said, when she saw it was that it looked and tasted like \"sabudana\" (which is what tapioca is called in many of the languages in India).\\n\\nAs for the taste,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Rice/dp/B00BP36S7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodle Rice&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;does NOT taste even remotely like rice! Not only that but this \"rice\" doesn't even taste much different than any of the other varieties of Miracle Noodle pastas -- and as a matter of fact, it tastes more like an orzo pasta than rice, and I don't know on what planet this could in any way be considered \"rice\"!\\n\\nEven though I followed all the directions, and experimented with these in many different kinds of recipes, NOTHING I tried made it taste even REMOTELY like rice -- and it would have been better if they had just labeled this as an orzo pasta or something instead. At least then, that would be more accurate and honest. Becasue calling this item \"rice\" is VERY misleading and a HUGE disappointment!\\n\\nWhich is why, although I LOVE the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Pasta-Angel-Hair/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodle Pasta, Angel Hair&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Pasta-Fetuccine/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodle Pasta, Fetuccine&lt;/a&gt;, I will probably never be buying this so-called \"rice\" again!</td>\n",

Especially since with these noodles, I never have to worry about carb content or even calories!\\n\\nMiracle Noodles are really a MIRACLE for those of us pasta &amp; noodle lovers on low-carb &amp; grain-free diets. Its so versatile, so far I've used it in soups, stir-frys, and salads, and its been DELICIOUS!!\\n\\nIn response to other reviewers on this page who have complained that these noodles have a fishy smell.......they are only right, in that when you first open the noodle package, there IS a bit of a smell. However, as soon as I've emptied the noodles into a sieve or colander and rinsed it in water (I usually use warm-ish water) for a few minutes, any &amp; all of the \"fishy\" smell immediately disappears.\\n\\nAlso to all those people who have complained about the \"rubbery\" texture of these noodles........if you buy these noodles, and go into the experience expecting to get an EXACT REPLICA of the conventional wheat-based and carb-filled starchy noodles/pasta, then you are going to be SORELY disappointed. Because these noodles are NOT made with wheat or any other high-carb grain. Miracle Noodles are made of a healthy natural water soluble fiber (that has NO fat, sugar, or starch) called Glucomannan, and konnyaku flour, which is made from the Konjac plant which has been used in Asia for thousands of years, and is wheat-free, gluten-free, kosher, and has ZERO net carbs and ZERO calories!\\n\\nAs such, because Miracle Noodles are not made with wheat (or any grain) they are NOT going to have the same starchy texture as conventional pasta. Instead, in my opinion, the texture of these noodles are more like that of ramen noodles, and as long as they are made the right way, they taste DELICIOUS!\\n\\nIf you make these expecting it to be just like regular spaghetti, where you just toss it in boiling water to cook it, and then drain out the water and mix it with tomato sauce and eat it, then not only will these noodles be a disappointment, but also you are missing out on the best potential of these noodles!\\n\\nBecause&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are so unique and unlike any conventional and usually wheat-based version, they cannot be made and consumed in the same way as regular pasta, and expected to taste the exact same. However, if these are cooked according to the package directions (rinse thoroughly in clean water, boil in salted water for a few minutes, and fry it in a skillet long enough to remove any remaining water &amp; moisture) and then used in appropriate recipes (in my opinion &amp; experience, these kinds of noodles work best in soups, and Asian stir-fry dishes) they still taste pretty good.\\n\\nWhat I usually do with these noodles is this. First I cut open the package and empty the noodles into a sieve or colander, and rinse them in water for a few minutes under the kitchen tap, lightly shaking the sieve/colander all the while to make sure that all of the noodles have been thoroughly rinsed, and are free of the \"fishy-smelling\" water it was packaged in. Once the noodles have been rinsed, I shake out all the remaining water from the sieve/colander, fill a small pot or saucepan with moderately salted water, and add the noodles and bring it all to a boil.\\n\\nAfter it has boiled for about 2-3 minutes, I take the pot off the burner, pour the noodles back into a sieve/colander to drain the water, and then put a little oil (I usually use olive oil -- but only regular olive oil, and NOT the \"extra-virgin olive oil\" which is not designed for the high temperatures of cooking) in a skillet and saute the noodles to get rid of any remaining water/excess moisture.\\n\\nThen in another (or the same) skillet, or a wok, I heat up some aromatic &amp; flavorful oil (preferably those used in Asian cooking like sesame oil) and add some fresh minced garlic, ginger and diced onions (at this point, mostly white or yellow onions with a smaller amount of green onions) as well as a little organic, wheat-free soy sauce. After a minute or two, I pour the noodles into that pan and stir-fry it with the ginger/garlic/onion/soy sauce mixture for a few minutes before adding various vegetables (mushrooms, green onions, matchstick carrots, etc.) and meats and/or seafood (shrimp, chicken, pork, etc.).\\n\\nNext, I add whatever Asian seasoning sauce I'm in the mood for at the time (whether a teriyaki sauce, or a Hoisin sauce, or if I'm making these noodles for people who like spicy food, then a \"Hot &amp; Spicy Szechuan sauce\" or whatever) stir it in, and let it all simmer together for a few minutes. Then I add some salt (I usually use Himalayan pink salt) and pepper to taste and mix it in well before finally turning off the heat, and letting it sit in the pan for a few minutes for the sauce to thicken a bit before serving -- and even though its not exactly like regular noodles, it is still GREAT nevertheless!\\n\\nAs someone who is currently on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;diet and unable to enjoy my 2nd favorite food (after sushi, steak and shellfish which all tie for the first place of my most favorite food!) of pasta &amp; noodles, I rhink that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are a wonderful substitute!\\n\\nAlthough I admit &amp; agree that even when prepared properly,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;still do not taste *exactly* like regular pasta, given that it has ZERO carbs and ZERO calories, in my opinion its close enough and it is a GREAT alternative for those of us who LOVE pasta/noodles but for whatever reason (being gluten-free, wheat-free [or even grain-free!] or on low-carb diets) are unable to eat regular pasta, to be able to enjoy noodles again!\\n\\nI just wish there were an equivalent alternative for bagels and baguettes because then, instead of just staying on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;diet only long enough to meet specific goals (like weight-loss) like I'm going to be doing, I'd be a lot more willing stay on this diet permanently the way its developer, Dr. William Davis recommends making it a complete lifestyle change!\\n\\nNow if only Miracle Noodle could just come out with as great an alternative for chewy bagels and crusty baguettes, I'd be ALL SET!!</td>\n",

However, Miracle Noodles are unique and UNLIKE the conventional (and usually wheat-based) versions of pasta, and as such, they cannot be made and consumed in the same way as regular pasta, and expected to taste the exact same.\\n\\nSo, if you make these noodles expecting it to be just like regular spaghetti, where you just toss it in boiling water to cook it, and then drain out the water and mix it with tomato sauce and eat it, then not only will these noodles be a disappointment, but also you are missing out on the best potential of these noodles!\\n\\nHowever, if these are cooked according to the package directions (rinse thoroughly in clean water, boil in salted water for a few minutes, and fry it in a skillet long enough to remove any remaining water &amp; moisture) and then used in appropriate recipes (although I've only used these noodles in soups and Asian stir-fry so far, I've heard that the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/fettucine-noodles/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;fettucine noodles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are really good in recipes of Alfredo sauce made with REAL butter, cream and parmesan cheese!)\\n\\nAs someone who is currently on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;diet and unable to enjoy my 2nd favorite food (after sushi, steak and shellfish which all tie for the first place of my most favorite food!) of pasta &amp; noodles, I think that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are a wonderful substitute!\\n\\nAlthough I admit &amp; agree that even when prepared properly,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Miracle Noodles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;still do not taste *exactly* like regular pasta, given that it has ZERO carbs and ZERO calories, in my opinion its close enough and it is a GREAT alternative for those of us who LOVE pasta/noodles but for whatever reason (being gluten-free, wheat-free [or even grain-free!] or on low-carb diets) are unable to eat regular pasta, to be able to enjoy noodles again!\\n\\nI just wish there were an equivalent alternative for bagels and baguettes because then, instead of just staying on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;diet only long enough to meet specific goals (like weight-loss) like I'm going to be doing, I'd be a lot more willing stay on this diet permanently the way its developer, Dr. William Davis recommends making it a complete lifestyle change!\\n\\nNow if only Miracle Noodle could just come out with as great an alternative for chewy bagels and crusty baguettes, I'd be ALL SET!!</td>\n",

She's on a (very) low carb diet and there are not many noodle like products which she can eat and keep her carbs to a minimum.  Yes, these noodles smell fishy upon opening.  BUT they do rinse up nicely and serve as an accompaniment for sauteed veggies and as a decent side for London Broil, baked chicken and the like.

Seasoning in the water that I boil these in. Seems to add some flavor to them but it also changes the color. Looks very close to the color of pasta!\\n\\n---------------\\n\\nIt's kind of sad to see so many have given these 1 star. Being someone who believes strongly in 'Low Carbs' are healthy, I worked at learning how these should be cooked. Maybe many of the 1 star people didn't care that much?\\n\\nAlmost forgot to mention, the exp date on the ones I received today are Jul 2015.\\n\\nRinse them in a colander (cold water) for a minute or two, there should be no smell now. Boil them in a pot for 3 mins, then rinse again (pat dry with paper towels and try to squeeze out as much liquid as possible). Now put them in your already heated non stick skillet. I do this on a setting of 3 on the glass top stove.\\n\\nAt this point, because I've never read where someone has said how much time to do this for, I've been kind of guessing or listening for 'squeakiness'. I just now made these and decided to extend the time for this part. Not sure if it was the extended time or that simply these noodles are better than the ones I've gotten at walmart, but these were really really good. The texture was really just like spaghetti.\\n\\nI top off these noodles with Bella vita low carb pasta sauce... wow, it's really awesome to be having spaghetti again!&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bella-Vita-Low-Carb-Pasta-Sauce-Spicy-Tomato/dp/B0079OQEAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bella Vita Low Carb Pasta Sauce Spicy Tomato</a>   \n",

you like eating rubber: Because they look and feel like exactly that: noodles made of transparent rubber. If you don't care or are planning in burying them in enough sauce you can't see them, go for it. Personally, I'm not that desperate to lose the calories and carbs from my diet.\\n\\nEdit: I've since found&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/FiberGourmet-Light-Spaghetti/dp/B003S1TNIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">FiberGourmet Light Spaghetti</a>, which while it's not calorie free, is lower in calories and much higher in fiber than any other pasta I've ever seen. It also tastes like regular noodles. I love it, and anyone that isn't happy with these should try it. Their crackers are also pretty good.   \n",

  Be prepaired to experement to find the best way to eat them.: bought the variety pack... the rice and the angle hair are ok.  I think for me they are thin/small enough to not be a substantial part of a bite, so less contribution to the mouth feel of the bite of food. The Fettuchini on the other hand, I couldn't handle it, felt like I was having a bowl of night crawlers >.< .  I had hoped you could crisp them up some, but all you do is reduce the water making them more chewy lol.  I drain them and then rinse them in a sieve thouroughly.   \n",

Miracle noodles, indeed. Changed my life!: This product has seriously changed my LIFE. I fight every day to keep my weight at its current level, and I simply must avoid carbs. The conflict is that my favorite food, since I was a child is spaghetti with meat sauce. Until I learned about this nearly unbelievable product, I  had to eat spaghetti sauce on bean sprouts (ugh!) or green beans (yuck) or spaghetti squash (wahhhh!) and people say they can pretend they are eating spaghetti but those substitutes are nothing like real noodles. AND THEN I FOUND MIRACLE NOODLES AND MIRACULOUS THEY ARE, INDEED! iMAGINE HOW this could exist: noodles that are EXACTLY like normal noodles, except they have ZERO CALORIES AND ZERO CARBS. It's almost like dreaming, to try to grasp that this product could even exist. I was once warned AGAINST this product by someone who said it tastes awful. It turns out that she did NOT follow the instructions on how to prepare them. When they come out of the bag, they smell like fish! You will worry and think there is no hope. But just go forward following the directions exactly. A lot of rinsing, 2 minutes of boiling, then a little while of cooking them in a dry pan. Is ANY kind of spaghetti so fast to prepare? And then you couldn't tell them from real spaghetti in a million years.  I will be very disappointed in you if you say there is anything imperfect about these, because if you say that, then I know you didn't follow the instructions carefully. I love them so much, I gave them as Christmas gifts. No one could believe it! ALL YOU CAN EAT spaghetti with no calories or carbs!!! Now I have subscribed to have them delivered monthly. I have to say you are simply out of your mind if you don't try these. You can eat ALL THE SPAGHETTI YOU WANT NOW. How did anyone create these? I don't know. But they are a MIRACLE and really changed my life.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Zero-Carb-Gluten-Free-Shirataki-Pasta-Fettuccini-7-Ounce-Pack-of-6/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Zero Carb, Gluten Free Shirataki Pasta, Fettuccini, 7-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>   \n",

                                           These make your plate \"full\" and plenty.: Holly guacamole, I love these things! Follow instructions and get creative with spices and sauces. The \"funky\" smell so many have mentioned is no big deal and goes away. Texture is good, specially if you like ramen or asian food.\\n If you are like me and \"eat with your eyes\", more than with your stomach (talking about quantity here), these will make your plate look and feel full without the added calories.

Disappointing..............Tastes NOTHING Like Real Rice!!!: When I decided to buy this&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Rice/dp/B00BP36S7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Rice</a>&nbsp;I did so, after having bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Angel-Hair-Pasta/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Angel Hair Pasta</a>&nbsp;and ABSOLUTELY LOVING it. Because I am on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wheat Belly</a>&nbsp;diet, which prohibits the consumption of wheat & any product made with wheat (pasta, bread, crackers, etc.) and I LOVE pasta & noodles, which are my favorite food after sushi, steak & shellfish, I was so glad to find the Miracle Noodle angel hair and fettucine pasta.\\n\\nHowever, even though&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wheat Belly</a>&nbsp;is primarily a wheat-free diet, because its also supposed to be low-carb & grain-free, other non-wheat grains & starchy carbs like rice, potatoes and corn are discouraged (or at least advised to only consume in very limited amounts as rarely as possible)\\n\\nUnfortunately I LOVE basmati rice -- especially when having it with the \"Morey's Seafood\" brand of \"Seasoned Grill Wild-Caught Alaskan Salmon\" which I get from the frozen food section at Costco (and prior to that, at Sam's Club) and ever since I started the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wheat Belly</a>&nbsp;diet, I was missing having rice so much that I mostly stopped eating the Morey's Seafood Seasoned Grill Salmon, because it just wasn't the same without the fluffy & buttery basmati rice to enjoy it with.\\n\\nThen I happened to see a listing for this Miracle Noodle Rice while ordering the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Angel-Hair-Pasta/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Angel Hair Pasta</a>&nbsp;and I knew I just HAD to try it.\\n\\nNow before going any further, I just wanted to clarify that when I ordered this&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Rice/dp/B00BP36S7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Rice</a>&nbsp;I had NO illusions whatsoever that this would taste like basmati rice, in any way! Even before I ordered this, I knew it would be difficult if not impossible to replicate the taste & texture of basmati rice into a no-carb calorie free version. So despite the name of the brand, I was NOT expecting a miracle. However, while I knew that it would probably not taste like basmati rice -- I was hoping that it would at least taste like SOME kind of rice.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I was wrong! Not only does it not LOOK like rice but it also does NOT taste like ANY kind of rice either!\\n\\nThis so-called \"rice\" is a bunch of tiny white little balls, that kind of look like caviar (though I've never had caviar, this looks like a white version of it!) or tapioca. In fact, when I made this for a close friend, one of the first things she said, when she saw it was that it looked and tasted like \"sabudana\" (which is what tapioca is called in many of the languages in India).\\n\\nAs for the taste,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Rice/dp/B00BP36S7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Rice</a>&nbsp;does NOT taste even remotely like rice! Not only that but this \"rice\" doesn't even taste much different than any of the other varieties of Miracle Noodle pastas -- and as a matter of fact, it tastes more like an orzo pasta than rice, and I don't know on what planet this could in any way be considered \"rice\"!\\n\\nEven though I followed all the directions, and experimented with these in many different kinds of recipes, NOTHING I tried made it taste even REMOTELY like rice -- and it would have been better if they had just labeled this as an orzo pasta or something instead. At least then, that would be more accurate and honest. Becasue calling this item \"rice\" is VERY misleading and a HUGE disappointment!\\n\\nWhich is why, although I LOVE the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Pasta-Angel-Hair/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Pasta, Angel Hair</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Pasta-Fetuccine/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Pasta, Fetuccine</a>, I will probably never be buying this so-called \"rice\" again!   \n",

Especially since with these noodles, I never have to worry about carb content or even calories!\\n\\nMiracle Noodles are really a MIRACLE for those of us pasta & noodle lovers on low-carb & grain-free diets. Its so versatile, so far I've used it in soups, stir-frys, and salads, and its been DELICIOUS!!\\n\\nIn response to other reviewers on this page who have complained that these noodles have a fishy smell.......they are only right, in that when you first open the noodle package, there IS a bit of a smell. However, as soon as I've emptied the noodles into a sieve or colander and rinsed it in water (I usually use warm-ish water) for a few minutes, any & all of the \"fishy\" smell immediately disappears.\\n\\nAlso to all those people who have complained about the \"rubbery\" texture of these noodles........if you buy these noodles, and go into the experience expecting to get an EXACT REPLICA of the conventional wheat-based and carb-filled starchy noodles/pasta, then you are going to be SORELY disappointed. Because these noodles are NOT made with wheat or any other high-carb grain. Miracle Noodles are made of a healthy natural water soluble fiber (that has NO fat, sugar, or starch) called Glucomannan, and konnyaku flour, which is made from the Konjac plant which has been used in Asia for thousands of years, and is wheat-free, gluten-free, kosher, and has ZERO net carbs and ZERO calories!\\n\\nAs such, because Miracle Noodles are not made with wheat (or any grain) they are NOT going to have the same starchy texture as conventional pasta. Instead, in my opinion, the texture of these noodles are more like that of ramen noodles, and as long as they are made the right way, they taste DELICIOUS!\\n\\nIf you make these expecting it to be just like regular spaghetti, where you just toss it in boiling water to cook it, and then drain out the water and mix it with tomato sauce and eat it, then not only will these noodles be a disappointment, but also you are missing out on the best potential of these noodles!\\n\\nBecause&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodles</a>&nbsp;are so unique and unlike any conventional and usually wheat-based version, they cannot be made and consumed in the same way as regular pasta, and expected to taste the exact same. However, if these are cooked according to the package directions (rinse thoroughly in clean water, boil in salted water for a few minutes, and fry it in a skillet long enough to remove any remaining water & moisture) and then used in appropriate recipes (in my opinion & experience, these kinds of noodles work best in soups, and Asian stir-fry dishes) they still taste pretty good.\\n\\nWhat I usually do with these noodles is this. First I cut open the package and empty the noodles into a sieve or colander, and rinse them in water for a few minutes under the kitchen tap, lightly shaking the sieve/colander all the while to make sure that all of the noodles have been thoroughly rinsed, and are free of the \"fishy-smelling\" water it was packaged in. Once the noodles have been rinsed, I shake out all the remaining water from the sieve/colander, fill a small pot or saucepan with moderately salted water, and add the noodles and bring it all to a boil.\\n\\nAfter it has boiled for about 2-3 minutes, I take the pot off the burner, pour the noodles back into a sieve/colander to drain the water, and then put a little oil (I usually use olive oil -- but only regular olive oil, and NOT the \"extra-virgin olive oil\" which is not designed for the high temperatures of cooking) in a skillet and saute the noodles to get rid of any remaining water/excess moisture.\\n\\nThen in another (or the same) skillet, or a wok, I heat up some aromatic & flavorful oil (preferably those used in Asian cooking like sesame oil) and add some fresh minced garlic, ginger and diced onions (at this point, mostly white or yellow onions with a smaller amount of green onions) as well as a little organic, wheat-free soy sauce. After a minute or two, I pour the noodles into that pan and stir-fry it with the ginger/garlic/onion/soy sauce mixture for a few minutes before adding various vegetables (mushrooms, green onions, matchstick carrots, etc.) and meats and/or seafood (shrimp, chicken, pork, etc.).\\n\\nNext, I add whatever Asian seasoning sauce I'm in the mood for at the time (whether a teriyaki sauce, or a Hoisin sauce, or if I'm making these noodles for people who like spicy food, then a \"Hot & Spicy Szechuan sauce\" or whatever) stir it in, and let it all simmer together for a few minutes. Then I add some salt (I usually use Himalayan pink salt) and pepper to taste and mix it in well before finally turning off the heat, and letting it sit in the pan for a few minutes for the sauce to thicken a bit before serving -- and even though its not exactly like regular noodles, it is still GREAT nevertheless!\\n\\nAs someone who is currently on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wheat Belly</a>&nbsp;diet and unable to enjoy my 2nd favorite food (after sushi, steak and shellfish which all tie for the first place of my most favorite food!) of pasta & noodles, I rhink that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodles</a>&nbsp;are a wonderful substitute!\\n\\nAlthough I admit & agree that even when prepared properly,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodles</a>&nbsp;still do not taste *exactly* like regular pasta, given that it has ZERO carbs and ZERO calories, in my opinion its close enough and it is a GREAT alternative for those of us who LOVE pasta/noodles but for whatever reason (being gluten-free, wheat-free [or even grain-free!] or on low-carb diets) are unable to eat regular pasta, to be able to enjoy noodles again!\\n\\nI just wish there were an equivalent alternative for bagels and baguettes because then, instead of just staying on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wheat Belly</a>&nbsp;diet only long enough to meet specific goals (like weight-loss) like I'm going to be doing, I'd be a lot more willing stay on this diet permanently the way its developer, Dr. William Davis recommends making it a complete lifestyle change!\\n\\nNow if only Miracle Noodle could just come out with as great an alternative for chewy bagels and crusty baguettes, I'd be ALL SET!!   \n",

Garlic and Herb Fettuccini, 7 Ounce</a>&nbsp;is especially great.  Marry it to some canned clams and basil and herbs fettuccine sauce and you've got a quick and delicious meal!  My personal hot tip on using ShIrataki noodles is to heat them separately from you sauces in a non-stick pan and get them dryer.  When they look a little opaque and dull, not so wet and shiny then serve them to put your sauce over or mix them in with the clams and sauce.  Enjoy   \n",

Especially since with this pasta, I never have to worry about the carb content or even the number of calories and yet its still DELICIOUS!!\\n\\nIn response to other reviewers on this page who have complained that these noodles have a fishy smell.......they are only right, in that when you first open the noodle package, there IS a bit of a smell. However, as soon as I've emptied the noodles into a sieve or colander and rinsed it in water (I usually use warm-ish water) for a few minutes, any & all of the \"fishy\" smell immediately disappears.\\n\\nAlso to all those people who have complained about the \"rubbery\" texture of these noodles........if you buy these noodles, and go into the experience expecting to get an EXACT REPLICA of the conventional wheat-based and carb-filled starchy noodles/pasta, then you are going to be SORELY disappointed!\\n\\nBecause these noodles are NOT made with wheat or any other high-carb grain, they are NOT going to have the same starchy texture as conventional pasta. But that does NOT mean that they cannot be just as YUMMY in their own right!\\n\\nMiracle Noodles are made of a healthy natural water soluble fiber (that has NO fat, sugar, or starch) called Glucomannan, and konnyaku flour, which is made from the Konjac plant which has been used in Asia for thousands of years, and is wheat-free, gluten-free, kosher, and has ZERO net carbs and ZERO calories! However, Miracle Noodles are unique and UNLIKE the conventional (and usually wheat-based) versions of pasta, and as such, they cannot be made and consumed in the same way as regular pasta, and expected to taste the exact same.\\n\\nSo, if you make these noodles expecting it to be just like regular spaghetti, where you just toss it in boiling water to cook it, and then drain out the water and mix it with tomato sauce and eat it, then not only will these noodles be a disappointment, but also you are missing out on the best potential of these noodles!\\n\\nHowever, if these are cooked according to the package directions (rinse thoroughly in clean water, boil in salted water for a few minutes, and fry it in a skillet long enough to remove any remaining water & moisture) and then used in appropriate recipes (although I've only used these noodles in soups and Asian stir-fry so far, I've heard that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/fettucine-noodles/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">fettucine noodles</a>&nbsp;are really good in recipes of Alfredo sauce made with REAL butter, cream and parmesan cheese!)\\n\\nAs someone who is currently on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wheat Belly</a>&nbsp;diet and unable to enjoy my 2nd favorite food (after sushi, steak and shellfish which all tie for the first place of my most favorite food!) of pasta & noodles, I think that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodles</a>&nbsp;are a wonderful substitute!\\n\\nAlthough I admit & agree that even when prepared properly,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodles</a>&nbsp;still do not taste *exactly* like regular pasta, given that it has ZERO carbs and ZERO calories, in my opinion its close enough and it is a GREAT alternative for those of us who LOVE pasta/noodles but for whatever reason (being gluten-free, wheat-free [or even grain-free!] or on low-carb diets) are unable to eat regular pasta, to be able to enjoy noodles again!\\n\\nI just wish there were an equivalent alternative for bagels and baguettes because then, instead of just staying on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wheat Belly</a>&nbsp;diet only long enough to meet specific goals (like weight-loss) like I'm going to be doing, I'd be a lot more willing stay on this diet permanently the way its developer, Dr. William Davis recommends making it a complete lifestyle change!\\n\\nNow if only Miracle Noodle could just come out with as great an alternative for chewy bagels and crusty baguettes, I'd be ALL SET!!   \n",

Yes !!!: My daughter swears by this product.  She's on a (very) low carb diet and there are not many noodle like products which she can eat and keep her carbs to a minimum.  Yes, these noodles smell fishy upon opening.  BUT they do rinse up nicely and serve as an accompaniment for sauteed veggies and as a decent side for London Broil, baked chicken and the like.  The different varieties are nice for eye appeal and texture.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Shirataki-Pasta-6-bag-Variety-Pack-44-ounces-Includes-2-Shirataki-Angel-Hair-2-Shirataki-Rice-and-2-Shirataki-Fettuccini/dp/B00BTMDALO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Shirataki Pasta, 6 bag Variety Pack, 44 ounces (Includes: 2 Shirataki Angel Hair, 2 Shirataki Rice and 2 Shirataki Fettuccini)</a>   \n",

Seems to add some flavor to them but it also changes the color. Looks very close to the color of pasta!\\n\\n---------------\\n\\nIt\\'s kind of sad to see so many have given these 1 star. Being someone who believes strongly in \\'Low Carbs\\' are healthy, I worked at learning how these should be cooked. Maybe many of the 1 star people didn\\'t care that much?\\n\\nAlmost forgot to mention, the exp date on the ones I received today are Jul 2015.\\n\\nRinse them in a colander (cold water) for a minute or two, there should be no smell now. Boil them in a pot for 3 mins, then rinse again (pat dry with paper towels and try to squeeze out as much liquid as possible). Now put them in your already heated non stick skillet. I do this on a setting of 3 on the glass top stove.\\n\\nAt this point, because I\\'ve never read where someone has said how much time to do this for, I\\'ve been kind of guessing or listening for \\'squeakiness\\'. I just now made these and decided to extend the time for this part. Not sure if it was the extended time or that simply these noodles are better than the ones I\\'ve gotten at walmart, but these were really really good. The texture was really just like spaghetti.\\n\\nI top off these noodles with Bella vita low carb pasta sauce... wow, it\\'s really awesome to be having spaghetti again!&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bella-Vita-Low-Carb-Pasta-Sauce-Spicy-Tomato/dp/B0079OQEAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bella Vita Low Carb Pasta Sauce Spicy Tomato</a>',\n",

It also tastes like regular noodles. I love it, and anyone that isn\\'t happy with these should try it. Their crackers are also pretty good.',\n",
       "       \"Be prepaired to experement to find the best way to eat them.: bought the variety pack... the rice and the angle hair are ok.  I think for me they are thin/small enough to not be a substantial part of a bite, so less contribution to the mouth feel of the bite of food. The Fettuchini on the other hand, I couldn't handle it, felt like I was having a bowl of night crawlers >.< .  I had hoped you could crisp them up some, but all you do is reduce the water making them more chewy lol.  I drain them and then rinse them in a sieve thouroughly.\",\n",

I fight every day to keep my weight at its current level, and I simply must avoid carbs. The conflict is that my favorite food, since I was a child is spaghetti with meat sauce. Until I learned about this nearly unbelievable product, I  had to eat spaghetti sauce on bean sprouts (ugh!) or green beans (yuck) or spaghetti squash (wahhhh!) and people say they can pretend they are eating spaghetti but those substitutes are nothing like real noodles. AND THEN I FOUND MIRACLE NOODLES AND MIRACULOUS THEY ARE, INDEED! iMAGINE HOW this could exist: noodles that are EXACTLY like normal noodles, except they have ZERO CALORIES AND ZERO CARBS. It\\'s almost like dreaming, to try to grasp that this product could even exist. I was once warned AGAINST this product by someone who said it tastes awful. It turns out that she did NOT follow the instructions on how to prepare them. When they come out of the bag, they smell like fish! You will worry and think there is no hope. But just go forward following the directions exactly. A lot of rinsing, 2 minutes of boiling, then a little while of cooking them in a dry pan. Is ANY kind of spaghetti so fast to prepare? And then you couldn\\'t tell them from real spaghetti in a million years.  I will be very disappointed in you if you say there is anything imperfect about these, because if you say that, then I know you didn\\'t follow the instructions carefully. I love them so much, I gave them as Christmas gifts. No one could believe it! ALL YOU CAN EAT spaghetti with no calories or carbs!!! Now I have subscribed to have them delivered monthly. I have to say you are simply out of your mind if you don\\'t try these. You can eat ALL THE SPAGHETTI YOU WANT NOW. How did anyone create these? I don\\'t know. But they are a MIRACLE and really changed my life.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Zero-Carb-Gluten-Free-Shirataki-Pasta-Fettuccini-7-Ounce-Pack-of-6/dp/B00BP36RW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Zero Carb, Gluten Free Shirataki Pasta, Fettuccini, 7-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>',\n",

Even before I ordered this, I knew it would be difficult if not impossible to replicate the taste & texture of basmati rice into a no-carb calorie free version. So despite the name of the brand, I was NOT expecting a miracle. However, while I knew that it would probably not taste like basmati rice -- I was hoping that it would at least taste like SOME kind of rice.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I was wrong! Not only does it not LOOK like rice but it also does NOT taste like ANY kind of rice either!\\n\\nThis so-called \"rice\" is a bunch of tiny white little balls, that kind of look like caviar (though I\\'ve never had caviar, this looks like a white version of it!) or tapioca. In fact, when I made this for a close friend, one of the first things she said, when she saw it was that it looked and tasted like \"sabudana\" (which is what tapioca is called in many of the languages in India).\\n\\nAs for the taste,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodle-Rice/dp/B00BP36S7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodle Rice</a>&nbsp;does NOT taste even remotely like rice!

Especially since with these noodles, I never have to worry about carb content or even calories!\\n\\nMiracle Noodles are really a MIRACLE for those of us pasta & noodle lovers on low-carb & grain-free diets. Its so versatile, so far I\\'ve used it in soups, stir-frys, and salads, and its been DELICIOUS!!\\n\\nIn response to other reviewers on this page who have complained that these noodles have a fishy smell.......they are only right, in that when you first open the noodle package, there IS a bit of a smell. However, as soon as I\\'ve emptied the noodles into a sieve or colander and rinsed it in water (I usually use warm-ish water) for a few minutes, any & all of the \"fishy\" smell immediately disappears.\\n\\nAlso to all those people who have complained about the \"rubbery\" texture of these noodles........if you buy these noodles, and go into the experience expecting to get an EXACT REPLICA of the conventional wheat-based and carb-filled starchy noodles/pasta, then you are going to be SORELY disappointed. Because these noodles are NOT made with wheat or any other high-carb grain. Miracle Noodles are made of a healthy natural water soluble fiber (that has NO fat, sugar, or starch) called Glucomannan, and konnyaku flour, which is made from the Konjac plant which has been used in Asia for thousands of years, and is wheat-free, gluten-free, kosher, and has ZERO net carbs and ZERO calories!\\n\\nAs such, because Miracle Noodles are not made with wheat (or any grain) they are NOT going to have the same starchy texture as conventional pasta. Instead, in my opinion, the texture of these noodles are more like that of ramen noodles, and as long as they are made the right way, they taste DELICIOUS!\\n\\nIf you make these expecting it to be just like regular spaghetti, where you just toss it in boiling water to cook it, and then drain out the water and mix it with tomato sauce and eat it, then not only will these noodles be a disappointment, but also you are missing out on the best potential of these noodles!\\n\\nBecause&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodles</a>&nbsp;are so unique and unlike any conventional and usually wheat-based version, they cannot be made and consumed in the same way as regular pasta, and expected to taste the exact same. However, if these are cooked according to the package directions (rinse thoroughly in clean water, boil in salted water for a few minutes, and fry it in a skillet long enough to remove any remaining water & moisture) and then used in appropriate recipes (in my opinion & experience, these kinds of noodles work best in soups, and Asian stir-fry dishes) they still taste pretty good.\\n\\nWhat I usually do with these noodles is this. First I cut open the package and empty the noodles into a sieve or colander, and rinse them in water for a few minutes under the kitchen tap, lightly shaking the sieve/colander all the while to make sure that all of the noodles have been thoroughly rinsed, and are free of the \"fishy-smelling\" water it was packaged in. Once the noodles have been rinsed, I shake out all the remaining water from the sieve/colander, fill a small pot or saucepan with moderately salted water, and add the noodles and bring it all to a boil.\\n\\nAfter it has boiled for about 2-3 minutes, I take the pot off the burner, pour the noodles back into a sieve/colander to drain the water, and then put a little oil (I usually use olive oil -- but only regular olive oil, and NOT the \"extra-virgin olive oil\" which is not designed for the high temperatures of cooking) in a skillet and saute the noodles to get rid of any remaining water/excess moisture.\\n\\nThen in another (or the same) skillet, or a wok, I heat up some aromatic & flavorful oil (preferably those used in Asian cooking like sesame oil) and add some fresh minced garlic, ginger and diced onions (at this point, mostly white or yellow onions with a smaller amount of green onions) as well as a little organic, wheat-free soy sauce. After a minute or two, I pour the noodles into that pan and stir-fry it with the ginger/garlic/onion/soy sauce mixture for a few minutes before adding various vegetables (mushrooms, green onions, matchstick carrots, etc.) and meats and/or seafood (shrimp, chicken, pork, etc.).\\n\\nNext, I add whatever Asian seasoning sauce I\\'m in the mood for at the time (whether a teriyaki sauce, or a Hoisin sauce, or if I\\'m making these noodles for people who like spicy food, then a \"Hot & Spicy Szechuan sauce\" or whatever) stir it in, and let it all simmer together for a few minutes. Then I add some salt (I usually use Himalayan pink salt) and pepper to taste and mix it in well before finally turning off the heat, and letting it sit in the pan for a few minutes for the sauce to thicken a bit before serving -- and even though its not exactly like regular noodles, it is still GREAT nevertheless!\\n\\nAs someone who is currently on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wheat Belly</a>&nbsp;diet and unable to enjoy my 2nd favorite food (after sushi, steak and shellfish which all tie for the first place of my most favorite food!) of pasta & noodles, I rhink that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodles</a>&nbsp;are a wonderful substitute!\\n\\nAlthough I admit & agree that even when prepared properly,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Miracle-Noodles/dp/B00BP36RTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Miracle Noodles</a>&nbsp;still do not taste *exactly* like regular pasta, given that it has ZERO carbs and ZERO calories, in my opinion its close enough and it is a GREAT alternative for those of us who LOVE pasta/noodles but for whatever reason (being gluten-free, wheat-free [or even grain-free!] or on low-carb diets) are unable to eat regular pasta, to be able to enjoy noodles again!\\n\\nI just wish there were an equivalent alternative for bagels and baguettes because then, instead of just staying on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wheat-Belly/dp/1609611543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wheat Belly</a>&nbsp;diet only long enough to meet specific goals (like weight-loss) like I\\'m going to be doing, I\\'d be a lot more willing stay on this diet permanently the way its developer, Dr. William Davis recommends making it a complete lifestyle change!\\n\\nNow if only Miracle Noodle could just come out with as great an alternative for chewy bagels and crusty baguettes, I\\'d be ALL SET!!',\n",
