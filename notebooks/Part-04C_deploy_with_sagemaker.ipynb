These ziti noodles though are weird. Their thicker and the texture is just off. I reccommend the angel hair and the rice. Those are my favorites so far.'\n",
      " b\"Spinach noodles -  yum!: I've been eating the fettucine noodles for about a year now.  I just tried the spinach and I love them!  I usually don't like spinach but these noodles are good without any sort of broth or spice to make them flavorful.  I like them much better than the garlic and other flavor-infused noodles of this product.  I'll be buying them monthly.  Highly recommended vendor and product.\"\n",
      " b\"Strange, but yummy: This is good stuff.  Great consistency and absorbs the flavors it's around.  I little weird to cook, but a great product.\"\n",
      " b\"Make sure you know how to prepare this specific noodle!: If you know how to prepare the product, it can taste just like normal noodles.\\n\\nI love the invention of shirataki noodles. If you're like me, indulging in noodle-based meals can be too easy.\\n\\nWith this product, you're free and able to stuff your face with pasta and noodles.\"\n",
      " b'Please try this product!: What a great substitute product! Going to save you thousands of calories in the future.'\n",
      " b\"Why do these smell like fish????: Didn't like them They had a weird fish smell\"\n",
      " b'Two Stars: Did not care for this product.'\n",
      " b'One Star: No taste or odor issue but the texture is like rubber bands.  Not tough just very weird'\n",
      " b'Not good at all: Gross like eating rubber bands soaked in butt.'\n",
      " b'Great was to add fiber: Cheaper than Wholefoods and priced reasonably.\\nGreat was to add fiber, lower calories and have your noodles too :-)'\n",
      " b\"Carb struggles no more!: I'm a pasta fanatic. From ages 2-26, I ate it nearly everyday. Then my metabolism decided it was done helping me out, so I had to cut way back and it made me so sad :( until I found about these noodles, pasta was my guilty binge food. I'd deprive myself for weeks then go ape over an entire box of fettuccine. Of course I'd feel terrible and scold myself only to repeat this pathetic cycle over and over.\\n\\nNow Miracle Noodle! It's not the same as regular noodles. It's just not so don't expect it. Rinse it, quickly dip it in boiling water, and serve them up!\\n\\nThese little lovelies are enough to keep me satisfied and ward off any binging episodes. I am set free! I can enjoy my mom's seriously amazing from-scratch spaghetti sauce without feeling like I have to PR on a run to make up for it.\\n\\nIf you have a complicated relationship with wheat pasta like me, do yourself a favor and buy these things.\"\n",
      " b'Great substitute for low carb diet: Great substitute for low carb diet, and the texture if very close to the real pasta and rice. Good buy.....'\n",
      " b'One Star: Could not get rid of the rubbery texture...made me gag'\n",
      " b\"Low / No Calorie Noodle Goodness!: When dieting, I buy this variety pack of Miracle Noodle Shirataki pasta consistently.  Why?  Because they are a great filler that has next to no calories.  With that being said, I wouldn't normally buy these due to the price.  But when attempting to lose weight, I expect to pay more for less calories and this fits the bill perfectly.  I typically cook these mixed in with a stir fry, and they take on the flavor of the food they're being cooked with.  One of my favorite things to do with these is make low calorie tacos / burritos by cooking these with a bell pepper / onion mix, spices, and a meat.  Delicious!\"\n",
      " b'One Star: yuck---sure they have zero calories but they are awful'\n",
      " b\"Good: Have on auto delivery.  They are my go to whenever I want to eat but don't want calories.\"\n",

      " b'glad I did: took a long time to get brave enough to try these, glad I did, they are very good!'\n",
      " b'Two Stars: Not a nice texture or flavour'\n",
      " b'Perfect in every way!: Love pasta and this is my carb free miracle!'\n",
      " b\"Intrigued and surprised: I didn't fully know what to expect, but I had read some reviews so I at least knew these had to be rinsed well. Oh boy did they. The liquid they (i tried the angel hair first)come in smells really gross, kinda fishy in a bad way. After rinsing for the recommended 20 seconds, the smell mostly went away, but not totally. I was hopeful that the marinara and toppings would cover the rest of the smell. I heated them up with the sauce in the microwave. I was a little surprised by the texture,  it's more rice noodle meets bean sprout than pasta in texture. The smell from the liquid did not carry over to the meal, but I should have patted the noodles dry, as they held water from the rinsing and watered my marinara sauce down too much.\\n\\nAll in all, though it's not quite pasta, it's a pretty decent substitute. It serves its purpose as a bland base and carrier for pasta sauce. I'm very intrigued by these noodles and a bit anxious about the rice since I imagine rinsing then won't be nearly as easy as rinsing the noodles were and I don't expect to be able to eat them plain like real rice.  Will try to remember to update once I have the guts to try it.\"\n",
      " b\"I'm glad others like them: I'm glad others like them... I've only tried the fettuccini and its like tapeworms, made of rubber.  I couldn't swallow them and my dog spat them out.  I tried to like them.  Just not for me.\"\n",
      " b'One Star: Too rubbery for me.'\n",
      " b\"Too slimy doesn't seem to dry out to a good constancy when cooking in frying pan after noodles are ...: Too slimy doesn't seem to dry out to a good constancy when cooking in frying pan after noodles are cooked...Use a non stick frying pan nothing but the noodles in it just not right somehow.\"\n",
      " b'GROSS!: These are extremely gross. I took one bite spit them out and threw the rest away. If you are going to buy these just buy one bag to see if you like them.'\n",
      " b\"Guilt free pasta helps keep our eating on track: We order these again and again as we try to mostly steer clear of processed carbs like flour pastas. Rinse well and add them to whatever you're making.\\n\\nWill they provide the exact same mouthfeel as flour pasta? No. But you can augment this by adding some olive or coconut oil to your dish. Last dish we had was a broccoli beef stir fry with these.\\n\\nWhenever we want guilt-free pasta, we reach for these.\"\n",

       "       b'A suggestion and how to prepare: I went to high school in Korea and grew to love a particular dish called Japchae.  I have PCOS, so it was recommended I start a low carb diet.  I was okay with giving up rice and most pasta (still waiting for a low carb mushroom ravioli), but sometimes all I want is a taste of home.  The angel hair miracle noodles are almost the perfect texture.  I bought the variety pack of the rice, fettuccine, and the angel hair.  The rice I used to make sweet coconut tapioca pudding, and I tried to use the fettuccine with Alfredo (I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS). As others have stated, use this product with Asian inspired dishes.  Japchae is very easy. I make it with chopped onion, green onion, egg, sesame seed oil, and soy sauce.\\n\\nNow, I have experimented with different ways to cook these, and the best way is as follows:\\n1. Rinse with cold water. I do this for a good minute or two, moving the noodles with my hand.\\n2. Drop noodles into boiling water. Boil for about a minute. Remove.\\n3. RINSE AGAIN.\\n4. Place noodles in a hot pan and stir. This is to help remove some of the water and helps get rid of the \"rubbery\" texture.  This is when I will start to add my sauce, veggies, and meat.  I will continue to stir fry the dish for a few minutes so the noodles absorb the taste.\\n5. Eat and be merry =)',\n",

UGH it was so gross - maybe the rice would be better, but too reluctant to try that now. cut up the spaghetti into bite sizes so it all goes at the same time....blah blah barf!!!\",\n",
       "       b'Rubber Bands: I tried making these two ways and they both turned out like rubber bands. Followed the directions on the pack in one of the recipes and then dried did it another way but the texture is HORRIBLE. I understand that these are not regular pasta but I ended up trashing my the food I made with them twice. Do NOT buy.',\n",

I enjoy this kind of noodle, when it really is angel hair, this could have been 5 star, if the shape were correct. Because of the false description in the label. I do not trust the brand.\\n\\nThe smell on opening is minor,; rinsing is easy, even without a colander.just using fingers and hand to drain. Many people might like this very much, but deceptive / mistaken labeling is a trust buster for me.\",\n",
       "       b'Totally unsatisfying: These products were quite a disappointment.  Although the product masquerades as rice and pasta, I can assure you there is little resemblance to the real thing.  Worse, they are quite expensive.  If you are looking for a low calorie pasta or rice substitute that does not taste like rice or pasta, you will have achieved 50% of your objective, they are low calorie and have no flavor whatsoever.',\n",

There was a smell but just like the instructions say the smell completely goes away by the time you are done rinsing. The prep was very easy to me: rinse for 15 seconds, boil for two minutes, dry in a hot pan which took about two minutes. It was very quick and easy for me. The consistency is obviously not quite rice because it isn't but is most closely like the texture of short grain brown rice. It was definitely better than eating my seafood veggie curry without any rice. Would make and order again!\",\n",

No, it doesn't taste like anything. But it's a perfect item to mix with sauces and other foods. For example today I cooked a delicious mix of ground turkey, onions, garlic, red peppers, carrots, tomato paste. And mixed the result with the magic rice. It looked like a rice medley and tasted wonderful since the item is a neutral addition. I've also mixed it up with salmon and skim cream cheese, soy sauce, eggs, etc. Just plan on adding an element of flavor and you won't be disappointed. Especially at 0 calories!!!!\",\n",

Before buying I read all the reviews . I followed all the ways to cook these because others had wrote how to get rid of that highly offensive oder & rubber like texture . I did everything & these noodles & rice are so nasty my dog wouldn't eat them! If you enjoy eating tasteless gristle then this product is for you other wise save your money & RUNNNNNNNNNNN  !!! The End\",\n",

Rinse as per package, and it will still smell a touch. My first attempt I boiled it as instructed, then took a saut&eacute; pan and flipped it for a few minutes on high heat with garlic and gluten free soy sauce. We were actually amazed at the texture and flavor being semi firm and not mush, but also that it was not fishy or foul tasting at all. I honestly kind of wanted seconds! ... Which is the only problem with these - there is BARELY enough in one package for two people to have an ok helping. You're not going to have tons of leftovers. For the price, I honestly don't think that you get what you pay for, but they were a good change from the norm.\",\n",
